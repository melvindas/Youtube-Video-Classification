I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name
Sign up for your hosting plan
Install Wordpress
Install your theme
Start blogging
Setup your blog here for just $3.95:
++ 

// How to Write a Travel Blog

The really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.

In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.

I‚Äôve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:

Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling something
Paid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white strips
Adsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my website
Freelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businesses
Selling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month

// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger

// find your speciality
- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you‚Äôd be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you‚Äôd be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise
- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you‚Äôre interested in and own it

// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeed

The Bali Travel Guide serves as a guide and inspiration for people looking to travel to Bali for the first time. The Bali guide suggests sights to see, activities to do, or dishes to eat. It includes my top things to do and places to visit in Bali and is based on my travel to Bali during the summer of 2017. I spent roughly two weeks on the island visiting Ubud, the Gili Islands, and Seminyak. 

I tried to add as much helpful information as I could, which I hope provides a good idea on how to travel Bali or at least serve as a form of inspiration. If you have any suggestions or feedback feel free to comment below, as any feedback is appreciated, I hope you find the video useful. Don't forget to like and subscribe for more content!

‚ñ∫How to Make Money While Traveling: https://migrationology.com/how-to-mak...

The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!

There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.

First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. 

If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend:  [affiliate])

1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.
2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.
3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.
4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.

Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.

46,RMBJWk0b4z,Dal lavoro di TRAVEL BLOGGER al TUMORE AL SENO: 3 cose vere di Francesca Barbieri,"I cambiamenti sono quella cosa che, inevitabilmente, ci destabilizzano.
Creano una crepa pi√π o meno profonda nella nostra abitudine, magari non ideale ma certa, e ci tolgono dal territorio di ci√≤ che diamo per scontato.

Il rischio √® perdere quello che si √® costruito, che sia nulla o poco pi√π, o quanto abbiamo costruito con devozione, successo ed entusiasmo.

Eppure i cambiamenti sono a volte auspicabili, altri necessari; a volte una scelta coraggiosa, altre una necessit√† che ci arriva addosso senza chiedere il permesso.

In quest‚Äôintervista, Francesca Barbieri, travel blogger conosciuta nel web come Fraintesa, ci accompagna in un viaggio al di fuori dalla sua comfort zone, a seguito di cambiamenti che, in alcuni casi, sono stati frutto di una scelta coraggiosa che manda tutto a carte quarantotto, in un altro ‚Äì la diagnosi di un tumore ‚Äì un‚Äôinversione di rotta inattesa e spaventosa, che rimette in discussione tutto.

Compreso il modo in cui stai cercando di realizzare i tuoi sogni che, forse, hanno bisogno di pi√π slancio, cuore e di crederci ancora di pi√π. Anche se sei Fraintesa e gi√† ti stai ascoltando, e gi√† hai rivoluzionato la tua vita per fare loro spazio: ma c‚Äô√® sempre un sogno che merita di avere il suo tempo e per il quale ci mancava il coraggio.

50,35reI2AqbrM,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,"Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 

'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. 

In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different. 

This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. 

In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: 

As always, thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!",Travel Blogs

59,7V2pJOUe4E4,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Trerice, Cornwall","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. 

By the 16th century the Arundell family had become well-established and was connected by marriage to nearly all the other landed families in Cornwall.

The status of the family increased through various members gaining good positions at the Royal court. Their legacy is this grand manor on a Cornish scale.
 
The Arundells inherited Trerice through marriage around 700 years ago. By 1572 John Arundell V had begun building the house we know today. Ten years earlier his income had been boosted by marrying well.
 
Son of the builder of Trerice, Sir John Arundell VI earned the title John for the King due to his role in the Civil War, especially his defence of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth for Charles I.
 
After the restoration of Charles II, Richard Arundell became Baron Arundell in recognition of the support he and his father had given Charles I.
 
We know little about how the Arundell family lived at Trerice. The Arundell line died out in 1768, and Trerice passed to the Aclands.
 
It was the marriage of John, 2nd Baron Arundell to Margaret Acland in 1675 that eventually led to the great Devonian family based at Killerton inheriting Trerice.
 
Sir Thomas Dyke Acland never lived at Trerice but often stayed on his political forays into Cornwall. He also used the Great Hall for entertaining.
 
Initially arriving at Trerice as tenants of its last private owner, the Eltons took on the tenancy from the National Trust in 1953.
 
At his own expense, John Elton paid for the repair of the remaining parts of Trerice - and went on to rebuild the fallen north wing. His aim was to create a comfortable family home.

61,HMBQmTf-tsI,#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!),"#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!)

It feels like everyone now a days is interested in being in a travel blogger. Around the New Year, people get so excited and set all these goals for themselves. They think of a clever blog name, buy their domain, set up their wordpress and all that jazz,. After a few month, the excitement starts to fizzle, you're not as enthusiastic anymore. You're not seeing traffic to your site, or engagement, and then start wondering if you made a big mistake. You may start writing less and less, and just give up on it all together.

Let me ask you this. If you opened a restaurant or a brick and mortar shop, do you think you'd become profitable after a couple of months? You would have to have money saved up to pay ""rent"" because after all, it takes spending money to make money right? 

In this video, I‚Äôll talk about my #1 reason why most travel blogs fail (and no, it's not the lack of travel.)

62,WPpzhWSE6ng,Family Travel and Sailing Blogs about Exploring the World by Sea and Living your Dream,"Our new CHANNEL AD.!

A decade of planning, saving and sacrifice to eventually live the dream of traveling the world by sea.  We sold all our belongings, quit our jobs, rented the house, took the kids out of school and searched for the best cruising boat we could afford, before we were finally ready to go sail the world's oceans.

Our family vlogs tell the story of the amazing people we meet, the strange places we visit and the travel and adventures we have along the way. But they are also about the everyday trials and tribulations of trying to live off-grid, of remote working, making money as we travel, shopping, cooking, boat maintenance, home schooling, living on a budget and the everyday challenges of family life afloat.

We'd love you to SUBSCRIBE to our channel and SHARE our adventure with friends and family who might just need that little nudge to step outside their comfort zone to live their dream too.. and perhaps learn a little from our mistakes!

It is a popular place for tourists to visit and see where Hardy wrote Under the Greenwood Tree and Far from the Madding Crowd.

The cottage is traditionally built from cob and the thatched roof is a wonderful backdrop to the roses, honeysuckle and japonica that climb the walls. Catch the cottage on a sunny Summers day and you won't find a prettier place in Dorset to spend a couple of hours.

The cottage stands at the top of the hill off Cuckoo Lane in Higher Bockhampton and behind it stretches Egdon Heath, which Hardy wrote of in 'The Return of the Native'. Take your walking shoes and enjoy a walk through the woods and beyond into Puddletown Forest.

This driftwood cabin overlooks the cliff top in  North Cornwall, however, I didn't get to see it because of a locked gate.  It was made for a parson named Hawker, and was his quiet retreat with stunning views.

Robert Stephen Hawker (3 December 1803 ‚Äì 15 August 1875) was an Anglican priest, poet, antiquarian of Cornwall and reputed eccentric. He is best known as the writer of The Song of the Western Men with its chorus line of And shall Trelawny die? / Here's twenty thousand Cornish men / will know the reason why!, which he published anonymously in 1825. His name became known after Charles Dickens acknowledged his authorship of ""The Song of the Western Men"" in the serial magazine Household Words.

He was an eccentric man, known for dressing up as a mermaid and excommunicating his cat for mousing on a sunday!

Lanhydrock is unquestionably one of the most impressive (and popular) historic houses in Cornwall. Built of local grey slate and granite around an inner courtyard, the house dates to 1640, though most of the current building was the result of rebuilding after a fire in 1881.

Tintagel Old Post Office is a 14th-century stone house, built to the plan of a medieval manor house, situated in Tintagel, Cornwall, United Kingdom. The house and its surrounding cottage garden are in the ownership of the National Trust, and the building is Grade I listed.

The name dates from the Victorian period when it briefly held a licence to be the letter receiving station for the district. The Trust has restored it to this condition. It was among the early acquisitions of the Trust (1903) and closes in the winter months

87,WMhkRzeGIMI,How to Be a Travel Blogger ‚Äî Creating Great Content,"This is the intro video for the course Being a Travel Blogger (Even When You're Not Traveling!). If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: 

You don‚Äôt have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.

There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: )

Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you‚Äôre not traveling? It‚Äôs a unique form of writer‚Äôs block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it‚Äôs been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What‚Äôs a travel blogger to do?

Well, I‚Äôm here to help you kick that writer‚Äôs block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",Travel Blogs

In this episode I attain celebrity status by being recognised when I arrive at HIdcote Gardens near Stow.

Now, don't get me wrong, I was a little worried what Rose was going to say, but it turns out the vlogging thing is well received and I was able to offer some feedback to her, after my visit.

So, this is my trip to a very pleasant garden of many features.

The Vyne is a Tudor manor house associated with King Henry 8th and other prominent figures in history

Located near Basingstoke, it is a large estate and house, which is under repair until the end of 2017.

In my tour around the house, I was confronted in public, being told to stop filming (but stills are ok) after a staff member chatted to me regarding the GoPro and equipment, but did not just tell me - instead of going off and reporting me.  Even reception made no mention of it.  

The saving grace was the roof top view.

Castle Drogo was originally built between 1910 and 1930 for Julius Drewe, a self-made millionaire whose chain of Home and Colonial Stores enabled him to semi-retire in 1899 at the age of 33. 

The foundation stone was laid on Drewe's 55th birthday in 1911 and construction took 20 years.

Some aspects of the castle are not accessible, but the garden is ramped despite some steep inclines and bumpy surfaces.

There is also major roofing works being undertaken at the time of the visit, with a view from above for the abler who can climb stairs.

25 Things to do in Toronto, Ontario Travel Guide and Top Attractions in Toronto, Canada Video Transcript:

Toronto is considered Canada‚Äôs melting pot. It is said that half of the people living in Toronto were born outside of the country, so that means lots of different languages, sights and flavours, which make the city a really fun place to explore. With only a few days in Toronto, we set out to visit a mix of neighbourhoods, top attractions, and of course, we also made time to sample plenty of food. The following travel guide will showcase 25 things to do in Toronto, so if you‚Äôre planning a trip here or you need some travel inspiration, be sure to stick around as we take you on a city tour. 

And that‚Äôs a wrap for TO! We hope you enjoyed this city guide and that it gave you some ideas of what to see and where to go on your trip. As always if you have any suggestions of things to do in Toronto that we may not have mentioned, feel free to share those with fellow travellers in the comments below.

FAQ:

- Can I use this music in my videos?

To use this music in your videos or media projects, you must first purchase a license from the link above. You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel. This is very important as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.

- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?*

'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.

Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. This gives you the rights to use the music and is also how I earn my living and feed my cat! :)

- Do I have to buy a license for every video I make?

No, you only need to purchase one 'regular' / standard license in order to use it in all your videos on YouTube, forever. If you wish to use another song, then you'll need to purchase another license for that song. 

- Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?

Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to me in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use my works on your videos, which is also needed if you looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.",Travel Blogs

Charlecote Park (grid reference SP263564) is a grand 16th-century country house, surrounded by its own deer park, on the banks of the River Avon near Wellesbourne, about 4 miles (6 km) east of Stratford-upon-Avon and 5.5 miles (9 km) south of Warwick, Warwickshire, England. It has been administered by the National Trust since 1946 and is open to the public. It is a Grade I listed building.

The Lucy family owned the land since 1247. Charlecote Park was built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy, and Queen Elizabeth I stayed in the room that is now the drawing room. Although the general outline of the Elizabethan house remains, nowadays it is in fact mostly Victorian. Successive generations of the Lucy family had modified Charlecote Park over the centuries, but in 1823, George Hammond Lucy (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1831) inherited the house and set about recreating the house in its original style.

Killerton is an 18th-century house in Broadclyst, Exeter, Devon, England, which, with its hillside garden and estate, has been owned by the National Trust since 1944 and is open to the public. The National Trust displays the house as a comfortable home. On display in the house is a collection of 18th- to 20th-century costumes, originally known as the Paulise de Bush collection, shown in period rooms.

The estate covers some 2590 hectares (25.9 km2, 6400 acres).Included in the Estate is a steep wooded hillside with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort on top of it, also known as Dolbury which has also yielded evidence of Roman occupation, thought to be a possible fort or marching camp within the Hillfort.

Killerton House itself and the Bear's Hut summerhouse in the grounds are Grade II* listed buildings.The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

This video is based of this Reddit post: 
The website in question is: 

Practical Wanderlust is a site that knows what it is. Practical travel advice, a little bit of story telling and a whole lot of work to make travel content that is insanely helpful. In the post she breaks down how she make money from blogging.

As someone who loves to travel, I sincerely appreciate the design and work ethic she has put into her blog. Anyways, enjoy the video :)

How do bloggers make money from blogging?

Her main sources of income are advertising at over 3k a month as well as professional writing gigs at 3k a month. This is followed up by affiliate marketing for another 3k. Of this affiliate marketing, about half is from Amazon and the other half are various other programs.

152,rrWjw1HroUQ,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Dunster Castle, North Somerset","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the 

important stuff relative to accessibility. 

In this episode, I visit Dunster Castle, near Minehead in North Somerset.  A setttlement has been around here for 12,000 years and at one time the castle, high on a hill, had the sea lapping around nearby - now a good couple of miles distant.

The property is ""accessible"" to wheelchair users who are happy to use the stair climber or to walk up 4 steps at the rear with the limitation of only seeing the ground floor but this is the expected scenario in any case with old properties such as these.

David Moore, Manager, was very accommodating and extremely helpful and indeed all the staff made me feel very welcome.

Clouds Hill is an isolated cottage near Wareham in the county of Dorset in South West England. It is the former home of T. E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"") and is now run as a writer's home museum by the National Trust. The site is in the parish of Turners Puddle in Purbeck District.

The small building has colourwashed brick walls and a tiled roof. It was probably built as forester's cottage in the early 19th century. The lintel over the door now bears a Greek inscription Œø·Ωê œÜœÅŒøŒΩœÑ·Ω∂œÇ (""Why Worry""). It is now a Grade II* listed building as ""Clouds Hill (Lawrence of Arabia's Cottage)""; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015.

154,x1k3EJvv4,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Clyston Mill, near Exeter","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. 

The miller had an 'eye' for the flow of the water, an 'ear' for the sound of stones grounding, a 'thumb' for the quality of flour and a 'feel' for the slow working of the mill.

There has been a mill named Clyston at Broadclyst for many hundreds of years. The first mention of it was first made in The Domesday Book in 1086, where it was referred to as Clistone/tona mill. Its location was a mystery at this time, but it was thought to be on a stretch of a river north of where the mill is today.

In 1806, Samuel Flood had the mill and a windmill ion the other side of the village. Proof of it in this location was given in 1859 when tenant miller Richard Burton was unable to mill flour on many occasions due to the lack of water, so he bought a steam engine from London to power the mill. 

In 1862, a disastrous fire started in the mill stable and ruined the dwelling house, but luckily the mill and its machinery were saved. The waterwheel used to drive the millstones was a low-breast shot wheel made mainly of cast iron and wooden cogs. 

In the 1930s, the mill was a very busy place, active into the early twentieth century. It pressed apples from 1915, ground corn into the 1930s and pumped water until the 1940s when the water tower was built. 

The mill‚Äôs machinery was also used to drive equipment for pulping and pressing apples for cider. The cider press, apple crusher and some barrels are on display in what was the pump house.

Snowshill Manor is in the cotswolds, and from the start mobility was challenged. Because this was late in the day, there were no disabled bays. Then I got stuck in the gravel.  I discovered there was no ramps and access to the house limited.

25 Things to do in Madrid, Spain | Top Attractions Travel Guide Travel Video Transcript:

Hola y bienvenidos a Madrid. This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city.  

Final thoughts on your time in Madrid. Well, I really enjoyed the city. And I really found that it is super walk-able. We were here for 10 days and we hardly had to take the metro at all. We just took the bus once when we were visiting the stadium but the rest of the time we were able to walk wherever we needed to go. And also I think it is a great city for art lovers. There are so many galleries and museums to check out. And a lot of them are free in the evening. So keep that in mind.

And now it is your turn. What did you think of Madrid? You know what? I absolutely loved Madrid. It is a city that just really clicked with me. We have a lot of friends that are living here long term and prior to coming here I had no idea like why would someone want to come to Madrid? Now I totally get it. I love the culture, I love the food, I love the nightlife. Everything is really cheap. I go to the grocery store and I can get a one liter thing of wine for just over a Euro. It is just a really affordable fun city to be in. And it is somewhere I hope I have a chance to come back to again soon.

And that is a wrap of our time in Madrid! We had a splendid time and were truly sad to say goodbye to the city, but that just means we'll have to come back again. If you have any travel tips for Madrid, feel free to share those in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Spain series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Spanish culture, Spanish arts, Spanish foods, Spanish religion, Spanish cuisine and Spanish people.  

All photos and video taken by Samuel Jeffery (Nomadic Samuel) and Audrey Bergner (That Backpacker).

In this episode I struggle over pebbles in the freezing cold wind to get the money shot of the beach and sea at this small north somerset village called Bossington.  

Definitely not an easy location to visit, but then it was a very small entry in the manual, which usually denotes inaccessibility.

In this episode I visit BASILDON PARK and HOUSE, a very inaccessible building apart from a few rooms on the ground floor. There are a lot of ramps with no where to go, and on a typical English weather day, this would be an average sort of visit reliant upon physical ability to climb a spiralling staircase to the main  floors of the house.

169,1frA2LT8xkk,I made my Friend a NEW Travel Blog (Puzzlewood Vlog),"I made my Friend a NEW Travel Blog (Puzzlewood Travel Vlog)

I love travel blogging I have had a travel blog for 3 years now. It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once. 

SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us! 

Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog! Keep watching till the end for that :)

Broadclyst is a village and civil parish in the East Devon local government district. It lies approximately 5 miles northeast of the city of Exeter, Devon, England, on the B3181. ... Until 1966 the village was served by its own railway station named ""Broad Clyst"".

Its church is 15th century, with an ancient cross. It has many battlements, pinnacles and gargoyles. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the year 1001, the manor at Broad Clyst was burned down by Danish invaders.

Killerton House, a National Trust property, is close to the village, as well as Broadclyst Cricket Club, which play within the gardens of Killerton House. The village pubs are the Red Lion Inn and the New Inn on Whimple Road. The Clyst Vale Community College secondary school is located in Dog Village.

Churchill Farm is the origin of the name of the Churchill family.

In this episode I go back to Stourhead, this time to visit the house. Because my battery died I wasn't able to visit the house.  It was listed in the guide book as having a stair climber and loan wheelchair, although to be honest I'd misread this as ramps.  As I discovered, you need to book before you go and perhaps if I had read the accessibility guide again, I might have known this.  However,  this is the point of doing these blogs.

Selworthy is a model village, albeit on a hill and inaccessible to me, on a scooter. The village car park features magnificent views of the valley with 12,000 acres of land.

A short episode due to the fact I had trouble walking on the tarmac car park area, let alone going down to the village itself.

184,_KDI-PGFQU,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Max Gate, home of Thomas Hardy","Max Gate, an austere but sophisticated town house a short walk from the town centre of Dorchester, was the home of Dorset's most famous author and poet Thomas Hardy. Hardy, who designed the house in 1885, wanted to show that he was part of the wealthy middle classes of the area, to reflect his position as a successful writer, and to enable him to enter polite society. The house was named after a nearby tollgate keeper called Mack.

Many of Hardy's possessions were dispersed before the Trust acquired the house, but we've furnished the rooms for you to enjoy the spaces he created to write and live in. He wrote some of his most famous novels here, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure, as well as much of his poetry.

You will find the garden much as it was originally planned, with high walls and large trees encircling the property to preserve Hardy's privacy. The sundial, designed by Hardy, was erected in his memory.

It is a quirky 18th-century, 16 sided house with fascinating interior decoration and collections

This unique sixteen-sided house was described by Lucinda Lambton as having 'a magical strangeness that one might dream of only as a child'.

It was built for two spinster cousins, Jane and Mary Parminter, on their return from a grand tour of Europe in the late 18th century. It contains many objects and mementoes of their travels.

The extraordinary interior decoration includes a feather frieze, gathered from native game birds and chickens, laboriously stuck down with isinglass.

There is also a fragile shell-encrusted gallery, said to contain nearly 25,000 shells, which can be viewed in its entirety using a touch screen 360 degree virtual tour.

What's my good morning routine and healthy daily habits that allow me to work for myself and have success as a travel blogger?

In this video I show you a typical day from waking up to going to sleep and everything in between, including how I start my day in the morning with meditation and journaling.

Then I show you what I eat to stay healthy, my cello class, pole dancing, and an exciting project I'm working on right now!

When I'm on the road, my routine can look quite different, but it still usually includes the same morning routine and healthy eating plus exercise habits. This is how I've managed to stay productive working for myself, because it can be tough, too!

Although not every day is a perfect picture of this, it's becoming more and more of a healthy routine for me now.

In this episode I go to Sandham Memorial Chapel, which is in the village of Burghclere, Hampshire, England. It is a grade I listed 1920s decorated chapel, designed by Lionel Godfrey Pearson. The chapel was built to accommodate a series of paintings by the English artist Stanley Spencer. 

It was commissioned by Mary and Louis Behrend as a memorial to Mary's brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham who died at the end of the First World War. 

The chapel is surrounded by lawns and orchards, with views of Watership Down.

In this episode I visit West Green House and Garden although the house isn't part of the deal because it is occupied by tenants and unavailable to view.

The main and deal breaking problem is the gravel, which made my scooter trip around the garden very uncomfortable.  If you recall my scooter even has suspension!

The majority of the West Green House Gardens is flat and suitable for persons with walking difficulties. However the Lake Field parkland has uneven surfaces and some of the paths around the various gardens are gravel and may be difficult for wheelchair users.

Refreshments are available from The Tea Room which serves light lunches, cakes, biscuits, tea, coffee and cold drinks. For special occasions, Special Afternoon Teas may be pre-ordered with 24 hours notice.

Our toilets are located in the Courtyard Garden. We have one toilet cubicle with wheel chair access.

It is a beautiful formal garden laid out around the 18th-century country house at West Green in Hartley Wintney in the English county of Hampshire. The house is listed Grade II*. It is well known for its gardens and for its summer season of opera.

20 Things to do in Krak√≥w, Poland Travel Guide video transcript:

We kicked off this trip to Poland with a visit to Krakow, a city people have been telling us to visit for years and now we know why. Krakow in the summertime was wonderful! We spent our time enjoying castle views from the river side, exploring neighbourhoods covered in street art, eating some of the best pierogie of our lives, and also discovering what we think may be the best ice cream. The following is our travel guide to some of the best things to do in Krakow!

Wawel Castle is Krakow's crowning jewel, and for centuries it was the residence of the kings of Poland. You can see a mix of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque architecture all in one place. 

While in the city, we also had to walk the Royal Route, which was once the historic coronation path of Polish kings.

After visiting the basilica, we spent a bit of time walking the Main Square, which just so happens to be Europe's largest medieval town square.

And that‚Äôs it for our visit to Krakow! We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other places to add to this list or any tips for fellow travellers visiting Krakow feel free to share those.

This is part of our Travel in Poland video series showcasing Polish food, Polish culture, Polish cuisine while visiting Krak√≥w Polska.

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",Travel Blogs

We had 3 days in Milan so we hit the ground running and tried to see and do as much as possible. We made time for major attractions like Il Duomo, Sforza Castle, and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, but we also veered away from the crowds in search of street art and interesting neighborhoods. This being Italy, we also tried to prioritize meals, sampling everything from pizza to risotto, and cappuccinos to aperitivos. The following travel guide will highlight 20 things to do when you visit Milan, Italy

1) Milan Catherdral (Il Duomo - Duomo di Milano - Domm de Milan)
2) Il Duomo Terrace 
3) Italian Breakfast - Cappuccino and sweet Italian pastries
4) Sforza Castle - Castello Sforzesco
5) The Galleria - Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II 
6) Risotto alla Milanese - Milan style risotto
7) Street Art around Porta Ticinese 
8) Colonne di San Lorenzo - Columns of San Lorenzo Roman Ruins
9) Boat tour down the canal (linea traghetti gaggiano milano)
10) Dine along the canal in Milan's Navigli District
11) Aperitivo drinks and buffet - Ap√©ritifs and digestifs
12) Shopping in Milan down Via Torino 
13) Visiting Chinatown for some Chinese food
14) Ride a bicycle in Milan like a local
15) Pizza al taglio (pizza al trancio) Italian pizza by the slice
16) Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio containing relics of the 3 Magi
17) Duomo Museum covering the cathedrals history in-depth
18) New City Views with a hop-on-hop-off bus pass
19) Museum of Natural History - Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano
20) Night views of Milan nearby Il Duomo



Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.

20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.

So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.

Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.

For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.

So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.

The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.

Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city‚Äôs canal system.

Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. 

So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.

And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.

This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture, Italian arts, Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it‚Äôs one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver‚Äôs clean air is thanks to it‚Äôs really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a way of life. But it‚Äôs a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we‚Äôre going to help you make the most of it! We‚Äôre going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let‚Äôs get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward ‚Äì a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain ‚Äì it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

Now it‚Äôs not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There‚Äôs ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn‚Äôt too bad in our experience.",Travel Blogs

With smart design choices such as a strong neck, back and sides made of ABS, the 0 nut, compensated saddle, solid geared tuners, and a rounded back makes this travel ukulele a serious instrument with a great tone.  

Come join me as I test out the Flight TUS35 on a hot day on the boat to see if it withstood the hot temperatures and the great outdoors.  Thank you to my Instagram followers that gave me some amazing questions to answer about the Flight TUS35.  I play several ukuleles side by side so that you can compare the tone to other ukuleles made of different tone woods.  CORRECTION!  The graphic for the Grace VanderWaal Signature ukulele was cut off.  It has a glossy finish to look like walnut, but it is laminate sapele.

What does it feel like to be present? To be here in the now and fully experiencing this moment. Free from any weight of the past or any anticipation of the future. Just free. Free to realize that only you can control how you feel. About anything. Free to see things for what they are and free to give your time and energy to what really matters.
Accept the fact that everything that makes up your world is there because you attracted it with your own thoughts. Realize that you can control your thoughts and emotions. There‚Äôs no big secret. Just choose to think better feeling thoughts. Listen to your emotions and chose to feel good. You can decide to be in a place of attraction and abundance.
What do you want to do in your life? What makes you tick? What makes you feel awe? Don‚Äôt be misled into thinking that you‚Äôre supposed to do anything. You are supposed to do only what you chose to do.  The world is vast and full of possibilities. Follow your bliss. Get out of your comfort zone. Stop looking for reasons why you can‚Äôt and look for reasons why you can.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel Blogs

ABOUT US
Hi, we‚Äôre Chris and Mandy, travel bloggers and creators from Australia. Since December 2015, we have been travelling and exploring the world full-time. We usually spend 1-2 months in each place we travel to and love really getting to know a place. One of our favourite ways to get to know a destination is through food, and we share all of our food guides here on Youtube and on our travel blogs. We love to pack light, travelling the past 3 years with carry-on only.

We have another travel blog all on Bali, AlmostLanding-Bali.com, we‚Äôve spent so much time in Bali and share everything we know and love about this beautiful island. We‚Äôve fallen in love with travel and blogging, and we wanted to create a space for other travel lovers and life dreamers.

The other day I was reading GlobalGirlTravels and I saw the bold claim ""Don't Start a Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown"".

Is this true?

What would Chinese people do? And would they start a blog in an apparently saturated niche like the travel one?

Well I'm currently living in China so I have a unique take on the situation...

From  onwards in this video I show some traffic statistics from a travel blog I started back in 2012. Has it been successful? Watch to find out!

üé• Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food - Local market in a small village just outside Negombo. Every village has a market day, lots of dried fish and fresh vegetables. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",Travel Blogs

T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Come to Dubai, the ancient City of Gold, for your next vacation.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania¬Æ, a ‚Äúcity‚Äù where children can roleplay various careers.

To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you‚Äôd like to try something a little different and don‚Äôt mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren‚Äôt staying there.

You can‚Äôt finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all.

279,NtQ6LNr6Gg,From a 9-5 to a Mega-Successful Travel Blog ft. Rachel Jones,"On the show today we have Rachel Jones, an incredibly humble, down to earth person, who ditched her 9-5 job as a nurse and ended up creating an extremely successful travel blog - ‚ÄúHippie In Heels‚Äù - with over 1 Million views per month!

Rachel has a very motivating story that will leave you inspired to find your passion, pursue your dreams and live the life you deserve! 

We often hear about the ""laptop lifestyle"" and working from anywhere in the world, making it sound superficial and almost not possible. Rachel's story is much different.

She takes us on her journey from leaving her ‚Äúsecure‚Äù 9-5 job as a nurse to making the decision to back-pack in India which then led her on an amazing series of events that ultimately led her to create ‚ÄúHippie In Heels‚Äù, an ultra-successful travel blog. Rachel has experienced some things that many of us can only dream of or watch on National Geographic.

One major thing that Rachel did on her journey was jumped & trusted that everything she did would fall into place. Making these leaps of faith over the past 6 years has led her to live a life that she would have never imagined when she first got on that plane to India.

Rachel had no idea how she was going to make money, where she would go, who she would stay with, however, she TRUSTED the process, and everything aligned for her. Today she begins a new chapter in her life and blogging career in the beautiful city of Merida in Mexico.

Her blog has been selected as ‚ÄúTop 50 Travel Blogs‚Äù internationally by the Expeditioner, Excellence in Blogging: Best Individual Travel Blog by SATTE Awards, and MANY MORE. She has been featured in Marie Claire Mexico, Cosmopolitan Spain, ELLE Magazine Netherlands, TripAdvisor, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post and so many more places.

After listening to this incredible story, you will feel absolutely inspired to make that leap of faith that has been on your heart for all this time.

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you in DEEP for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar, Pakistan. Peshawar is one of the oldest market towns in the world and has one of the richest street food scenes you'll ever witness! You need to travel to Pakistan!

We're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING BBQ Nisar Charsi Tikka Kababs, some amazing UNSEEN Pakistani Pulao, and ULTRA RARE PIZZA NAAN!!

You will fall in  love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

298,CjkRzSFck,Japan Travel Blog: Hakone Day Trip (From Tokyo to Hakone),"Visiting Tokyo? You don't have to restrict your holiday to just within the city, you can also take a day trip to Hakone from Tokyo via Train.

Make your way to Odakyu and purchase your tickets from the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center. The tickets would include whatever you need for the entire day. 

To get to Hakone, you would have to take the train and change to an uphill tram, before changing to the Hakone Tozan Cablecar which 1st stop would be at Mt Hakone.

You would be able to take pictures with this active volcano, and also try their famous black eggs.  

Once done, hop back onto the cable car which would take you past a few stops including one that gives you a great view of Mt Fuiji on a good day. 

Continue on the cablecar till the end to reach the cruise center, where you would board thie gigantic cruise ship which would take you across lake ashi. 

Take a short stroll and embrace the beauty of the beautiful sakura trees found along the river. 

A short 15mins walk and you would find yourself at Hakone shrine. Drink from their famous 9 headed dragon basin, visit the fertility tree and also take pictures at the huge tori gate by the lake.

299,F2sepCUnENg,Buenos Aires Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Buenos-Aires.d...

Named for good sailing winds, Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina, and home to nearly a quarter of the country‚Äôs two million residents. Come for the stunning European architecture, and stay for delicious cuts of meat, the city‚Äôs zest for soccer, and, of course, the tango. 

‚ÄúThe Paris of South America‚Äù boasts outstanding shopping and a friendly populace. A tour of Buenos Aires should cut through La Boca Harbor, where you‚Äôll find numerous street vendors, restaurants, and street dancers willing to give you a spin. Wander down the streets to take in colorful artwork, and make a game out of asking the locals what neighborhood you should tour next. Here‚Äôs a hint: with so much to see, everyone will give you a different answer!

Some will tell you to visit San Telmo for souvenirs, patio shopping, and crumbling historical buildings. Others will suggest Puerto Madero, a refurbished shipping port that boasts a mixture of old-world glamour and modern buildings. What everyone will suggest, however, is a stop by Plaza de Mayo. There you can take in the rosy architecture of the Casa Rosada, which was made famous by Argentine First Lady Eva Peron and the musical about her life, ‚ÄúEvita.‚Äù Take a tour and learn about her life, from her humble beginnings to her rise to power.

Cap off your Buenos Aires sightseeing with an evening walk through Puerto Madero, where you can get a late dinner and dance until the next day arrives.

313,E3ykgXDpOZ,HOW I TRAVEL FOR FREE AS A TRAVEL BLOGGER | DUSSELDORF ASSIGNMENT,"In my last video, I talked about how I afford to travel full-time. In that video I talked about how I pay for my travel but I also sometimes travel for free when I'm on a press trip - and today I'm going to show you what that means. 

I've been travel blogging for nearly 5 years, and during that time I've been on a fair few press trips. If you've been watching my travel videos for a while, you've probably seen content from a couple of those press trips! But I've never really shown you what it's like from behind the scenes.

So today we're going to talk about press trips. I want to show you how I travel for free on travel blogger press trips... and why it's not really free at all! Yes, my flights, accommodation, expenses and everything else are paid for when I'm on a press trip. But I still have to pay for it - in time and work. 

This press trip was a food tour of Dusseldorf, Germany. Each day had a different theme and the theme for the first day of the press trip was ""favourite drinks"". In my next video, I'm going to take you on a full food tour of Dusseldorf, but in this one I just wanted to talk about how press trips work and how I travel the world for free (kind of).",Travel Blogs

315,_-JOV5RzbTQ,Riga (Latvia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Riga in Latvia.
Riga is the capital of Latvia, a Hanseatic city and European capital of culture. Saint Petri Church is located in the centre of the city and has a long and varied history.  It features inner cross vaults modelled on those of the dome of the Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck‚Äôs cathedral, plus a circular arch and sturdy, red brick walls.  It is one of the most important sacred buildings of the Middle Ages and is closely linked with the development of the city. Mentzendorff House was a manorial property which German merchants had built at the end of the seventeenth century.  Carefully renovated, its original splendour has been fully restored. The middle class buildings of Elisabeth and Albert Street indicate the prosperity of its past occupants.  Like almost nowhere else, art nouveau has been preserved incredibly well with lavish embellishments and numerous motifs. Marien Cathedral is situated in the centre of the city and is the most important religious building in the Baltic States.  Its age, dimensions and contrasting architectural styles bear witness to a long history and its famous organ, built in 1883, contains a hundred and twenty four registers and almost seven thousand wooden and metal pipes. In keeping with the age-old traditions of the Hanseatic League, the very heart of the Baltic beats within Latvia's metropolis and, with an elegant lust for life, Riga is an extraordinary treasure!

317,3yD57Oo0ykY,"Travel Blog Sayulita Mexico - Good vibes, good times and beautiful hidden beaches","Daily Travel Vlog #78 - Today is a new day backpacking through Sayulita. Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for a new day and new adventure!!!

How to Vlog? This is the question I asked myself as I started out the new year. I am always looking to be more creative and I decided that this year will be the year that I start a daily vlog. So sitback and step into my daily life. 

Vlogging is totally new to me, but I hope to bring you on all my travels, adventures and all around exploring. 

A little bit about myself: 
I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.

My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon. We traveled to last year all around Mexico, China, Bali, Hawaii and throughout California and Neveda. I am hoping that 2016 will bring more excitement and more travels, so be sure to subscribe :)

Tokyo (Êù±‰∫¨), Japan, is one of the world's greatest cities, and there's so much to do and see when you visit. From temples and shrines, to gardens and museums, you'll never run out of attractions. Out of all the things you could do, I've chosen a top 25 list for this awesome city (and just so you know food is my first choice in Tokyo)!

1. Ameya-Yokoch≈ç („Ç¢„É°„É§Ê®™‰∏Å) - A giant open air market that offers clothes, cosmetics, food, and restaurants and bars.
2. Meiji Shrine (ÊòéÊ≤ªÁ•ûÂÆÆ) - This Shinto shrine, surrounded by beautiful forest, is extremely significant.
3. Ryogoku Kokugikan (‰∏°ÂõΩÂõΩÊäÄÈ§®) - Even if it's not fight season, you can go to the free sumo museum and eat sumo chankonabe.
4. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (Êñ∞ÂÆøÂæ°Ëãë) - The garden is a beautiful attraction in Tokyo, with French gardens, Japanese gardens, and a green house.
5. Ginza (ÈäÄÂ∫ß) / Yurakucho (ÊúâÊ•ΩÁî∫) - Ginza is a great area of town for upscale shopping and dining, while Yurakucho is famous for Izakaya bars and restaurants under the railroad track.
6. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (Êù±‰∫¨ÈÉΩÂ∫ÅËàé) - There are a lot of things to do in Tokyo where you have to pay, but here, you can go to the 45th floor for free.
7. Tsukiji Market (ÁØâÂú∞Â∏ÇÂ†¥) - One of the most famous attractions in all of Tokyo is the Tsukiji Market (ÁØâÂú∞Â∏ÇÂ†¥), the biggest seafood market in the world. 
8. Shibuya (Ê∏ãË∞∑Âå∫) - With the busiest intersection in the world, Shibuya (Ê∏ãË∞∑Âå∫) is also home to shopping and restaurant.
9. Sumida River (ÈöÖÁî∞Â∑ù) - At Tokyo's Sumida River, you can either just walk around the park and enjoy the riverside views, or you can take the Tokyo Cruise in a boat.
10. Tokyo Imperial Palace (ÁöáÂ±Ö) - This is the home of the emperor of Japan. To enter the grounds, you have to make a tour booking on the official website
11. Ueno Park (‰∏äÈáéÂÖ¨Âúí), Tokyo National Museum (Êù±‰∫¨ÂõΩÁ´ãÂçöÁâ©È§®) - Ueno Park is a huge public park in Tokyo with shrines, gardens and a number of museums.
12. Tokyo Skytree (Êù±‰∫¨„Çπ„Ç´„Ç§„ÉÑ„É™„Éº) - They call it Tokyo's biggest attractions. It's a huge communications tower with various viewing decks and galleries.
13. Harajuku (ÂéüÂÆø), Takeshita Street (Á´π‰∏ãÈÄö„Çä) - Famous for its street market and cosplay that takes place, this is a place in the city to see and be seen.
14. Senso-ji (ÈáëÈæçÂ±±ÊµÖËçâÂØ∫) - Visiting this temple is one of the top things to do in Tokyo, frequented by both tourists and religious pilgrims. It's the oldest temple in Tokyo.
15. Edo-Tokyo Museum (Ê±üÊà∏Êù±‰∫¨ÂçöÁâ©È§®) - It looks a little like a UFO, but it's one of Tokyo's main museums, that aims to preserve the history of the city.
16. Fine Dining - Let's just face it, Tokyo is one of the best cities in the world for high class dining - atmosphere, presentation, food, it's all just stunning!
17. Akihabara Electric Town (ÁßãËëâÂéüÈõªÊ∞óË°ó) - If you love electronics and gaming, you're going to love the area of Akihabara. You'll also find those infamous maid cafes here.
18. Tokyo Stock Exchange (Êù±‰∫¨Ë®ºÂà∏ÂèñÂºïÊâÄ) - Another free attraction in Tokyo is to be a guest at the stock exchange where you can see the Japanese Nikkei being traded.
19. Roppongi (ÂÖ≠Êú¨Êú®) - Home to the Mori Art Museum and a hotspot for nightlife in the city, Roppongi is an exciting area of town.
20. Odaiba („ÅäÂè∞Â†¥) - This area of Tokyo is full of things to do like Legoland, and Palette Town, an indoor amusement park. It's also known as Tokyo's entertainment island.
21. Yoyogi Park (‰ª£„ÄÖÊú®ÂÖ¨Âúí) - Located next to Meiji Shrine, and just a short distance from Harajuku and Shinjuku, this park is popular for exercise and dance.
22. Nezu (Ê†πÊ¥•), Yanaka (Ë∞∑‰∏≠ (Âè∞Êù±Âå∫) - Tokyo is a truly modern city, but there are a couple places like Nezu and Yanaka that have held strong to their traditional and cultural roots. 
23. Onsen (Ê∏©Ê≥â) - You've got to strip down naked before you can enter a Japanese public bath.
24. Mount Takao (È´òÂ∞æÂ±±) - Just 50 km from central Tokyo, this mountain is popular for climbing and is a sacred religious mountains. Makes a good day trip from Tokyo.
25. Food - Finally, food is the reason I visited Japan, and I think eating is by all means one of the best things to do in Tokyo. Food is everywhere, and not only does it taste amazing, but the care that goes into Japanese cuisine is incredible.

Thank you very much for watching this video that includes some of the best things to do in Tokyo. I hope it will give you inspiration to visit and eat through this amazing city.

The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly. 

3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:

1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more. 

2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs ¬£5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the ¬£5 and any remaining balance. 

3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

of the main squares of the city and eventually make our way to the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Sabatini Gardens. Later we take a run through Parque Del Oeste and find the Temple de Debod. 

As the capital city, a cosmopolitan city, a business center, seat of government, Spanish Parliament, and residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political centre of Spain. Madrid is characterized by intense cultural and artistic activity and a very lively nightlife.

Madrid, Spain

According to legend the original name of the city was ""Ursaria"" (""land of bears"" in Latin), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the arbutus (""madro√±o"" in Spanish), have been the emblem (The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city from the Middle Ages

Paseo del Arte

In English, the Art walk, is a place for beauty and art like no other in Europe. In only 1 kilometre, you will come across one of the most important museums in the world; Prado Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Reina Sofia Museum.  Beside this, you will find gardens, historic streets, science centres and libraries. If you don‚Äôt have enough time, try to go there! You will experience the best Madrid can offer. 

TOP 5 in Madrid:

Puerta del Sol

Puerta del Sol is one of Madrid‚Äôs most visited squares. The square is surrounded by many small and historical streets such as Calle Arena and others. Puerta del Sol is a great place to start a walk around the most traditional places in Madrid. 

Cibeles Fountain

Built in 1782, it has become a symbol of the capital. The fountain is built around the Roman goddess Cybele; symbol of the earth, agriculture and fertility. The goddess is depicted being carried by golden lions. Definitely a great palace to visit. 

Plaza Mayor

This square is part of the old part of the city. Plaza Mayor demonstrate the old architecture in Madrid; narrow streets, alleys and passageways, which were once used by swashbuckling swordsmen and medieval rogues.  Plaza Mayor is also well known to be the place for the best open restaurants and bars around this beautiful part of Madrid. 

Royal Palace

The largest palace in Europe, this place was home to the majority of the kings of Spain; from Charles III to Alfonso XIII. Nowadays, although the royal family does not longer live there, it is still used during important visits. The best thing about the royals palace; you can visit it yourself. A great way to admire the best of European architecture.

Our visit Edinburgh travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums and the city by day. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Edinburgh tourism brochure or Edinburgh, Scotland city tour.

20 Things to do in Edinburgh, Scotland Top Attractions Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our week in Edinburgh was action packed! We sampled gin and Scotch whisky, wandered down tiny closes, braved the crowds along the Royal Mile, ate our fill of haggis, and even visited a castle, a palace, and an abbey. So, if you‚Äôre looking for things to do in Edinburgh on your visit, this video guide will show you all of those attractions and then some! 

Edinburgh Castle is hard to miss as it dominates the city‚Äôs skyline. The first thing you should know about the Castle is that it‚Äôs not just one single building, so once you‚Äôre inside there‚Äôs quite a bit to see and do; you can tour the Royal Palace, see the Crown Jewels, watch the firing of the one o‚Äôclock gun, step inside St. Margaret‚Äôs Chapel, visit the National War Museum and so much more, so give yourself plenty of time. 

We also made time to visit the famed Royal Mile, which is the busiest street in Edinburgh‚Äôs Old Town. There‚Äôs quite a bit to see along here, so we first popped into the Royal Mile Market, which is set inside a former church, and from there we continued down the street, visiting little souvenir shops along the way. You‚Äôll have no trouble finding a kilt here!

Another activity we really enjoyed was taking a food tour with Eat Walk Edinburgh. We got to try a lot of delicious bites and beverages along the way, and one of the highlights was visiting the Fugde House. 

Another fun way to explore Edinburgh on foot is by wandering down the tiny closes. These small alleys were often named after a memorable occupant, and the Old Town is full of them. 

And that‚Äôs it for our visit to Edinburgh, Scotland. We hope you enjoyed following our travels and that this video gave you a few ideas of things to do, foods  to try, and places to visit around the city. As always, if you have any other suggestions of things to do in Edinburgh, feel free to share those with fellow travellers in the comments section below. Until next time!

This is part of our Travel in Scotland video series showcasing Scottish food, Scottish culture and Scottish cuisine.

We are teaming up with FoodieMommaPH (her channel: ) to bring you an entire street food series in Manila, Philippines! Today, Khee will be showing us the food and culture of Old Manila, around Quiapo Market and the oldest Chinatown in the world: Binondo! Thank you so much to FoodieMommaPH for making our trip in the Philippines unforgettable! She will be joining us for our entire MANILA STREET FOOD series, so go check out her channel!!!
 
We start our morning in front of Quiapo Church and try a classic street food style breakfast called taho, silken tofu, drizzled with brown sugar syrup and topped with tapioca pearls (1 cup 20 php/0.38 usd). Served out of a mobile bucket warm and fresh! Continuing through the market, Khee shows us some of her favourite childhood snacks. We stop to have some banana-cue, deep-fried bananas covered with brown sugar (15 php/0.29 usd each) as well as hot cakes (5 php/0.10 usd each) which are smothered in butter and sugar and served PIPING hot! So yummy, sweet and CHEAP!

Still hungry, we head straight for Chinatown in the heart of Manila to try some Filipino/Chinese specialties. Our first stop was to Dong Being Dumplings, an old ‚Äúhole-in-the-wall‚Äù shop where dumplings are made fresh on site! We ordered 1 serving of their special pork dumplings (200 php/3.83 usd per plate). The ladies were whipping these dumplings up at record-breaking speeds! The dipping sauce was sour from vinegar and spicy from the chili oil. Delicious! 

We then went deep into the Chinatown market to eat lumpia, the Philippines spring roll (70 php/1.34 usd each)! The wrapper is soft and holds together all of the delicious, and flavourful ingredients inside. Served fresh and with a side of chopped garlic for a full on FLAVOR BOMB! 

Next up, we found a rare (bicycle) stall serving binatog (20 php/0.38 usd each). Binatog is a sweet dessert made up of boiled corn, coconut flakes, and sugar. There are salty versions too! It is a very unique food that we‚Äôve never tasted before! 

Next we try a Cantonese/Filipino steamed and fried bun called Siopao. We ordered several sweet pork buns (22 php/0.42 usd each) and ate them fresh street-side, and even more to take home for later! We finished our street food craze at a local institution, Barrio Fiesta, for halo-halo, to cool off and satisfy our sweet-tooth! We ordered the halo-halo special (170 php/3.26 usd) with bright purple ube (purple yam), candied fruits, jellies and MORE! 

Thanks so much to FoodieMommaPH for showing us the incredible Quiapo Market and Chinatown in Metro Manila! Follow her for more Filipino street food and local eats in and around Manila!

342,URi_SsP,"How to Become a Travel Blogger: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly","How to Become a Travel Blogger - http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBlog

Becoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.

A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:

1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.

Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.

There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, 

Guest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:

2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.

Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.


This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEO
Ho to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:

SEO 1 - 
SEO 2 - kw - 
SEO 3 - OnPage - 
SEO 4 - OffPage -  

3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etc


Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.

Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.

As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out  - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.

But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.

We vlogged (video blogged) our day trip to Giethoorn, also widely regarded as Venice of The Netherlands or Venice of the North. We rented boats and toured the canals of the city. 

Giethoorn is charming with many channels and boats. Many tourists come here to relax and go to the nearby national park.

About a year ago Chinese tourists discovered Giethoorn. They come by tourist buses or local buses. The whole city is getting adjusted to the Chinese tourists, they are learning Chinese, have Chinese written menus and signs, and even the bus tickets for the public transport buses are now written in Chinese. But not only does Chinese tourists come here, Indians, Americans, Thai and other tourists started to discover Giethoorn too.

349,_eMAXOp2PvA,New Zealand: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar 5/5,"New Zealand: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar gives you all the info you need to explore this nation of Kiwis. Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown! When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away. 

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free: 


New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries. 

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep. 

The country is divided into two portions: the North and South Islands separated by the Cook Strait. The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

There are many beautiful must visit places in our small towns and villages too (hence the name small town bloggerüòâ) And the very first place I visited as a part of this is konaseema( delta region of east godvari and west godavari).

363,87If-Q2pJWQ,Philippines Street Food - AMAZING Filipino Food at Aling Sosing's Carinderia in Manila!,"One of the best Filipino food meals you can eat in Manila!
‚ñ∫Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Aling Sosing's is often considered to be one of the best carinderias, or local Filipino food restaurants, in all of Manila. The crowd that shows up to eat lunch here everyday reinforces the fact that they are no doubt one of the spots you want to be in Manila, if you‚Äôre a food lovers. When I was eating in Manila, eating at Aling Sosing's was certainly among the best local Filipino food restaurants that I tried.

Aling Sosing's is a very typical type of local street food restaurant, sitting on the corner of a street, near to Makati. Just like most carinderias, all the food is prepared ahead of time, and sits at the front of the restaurant. When you arrive to order, you just simply pick and choose the different dishes that you want to order, find a table, and they will bring you the dishes to your table. Additionally, some of the famous dishes to eat at Aling Sosing's are off the grill, and you‚Äôll smell the wonderful aroma of the grilling meats the entire time you‚Äôre eating, and it‚Äôs fantastic.

Ying and I arrived about 11 am on a weekday, and luckily we beat the main lunch traffic, but just barely. There were tables available when we arrived, but as soon as we sat down and order it filled up. Sof if you eat at Aling Sosing's Carinderia you might want to arrive before the main lunch rush. Additionally, some of the Filipino food dishes sell out fast, and they don‚Äôt cook them again for the day - once they are sold out, they are done for the day.

Here are the main Filipino dishes I ordered:
Pinakbet - A stew of mixed vegetables, oftentimes flavored with shrimp paste. This was the best versions of pinakbet I‚Äôve ever had.
Inihaw na tilapia - The grilled tilapia is quite well known at this restaurant. It was simple and delicious.
Inihaw na liempo - The grilled pork belly is one of their signature dishes, and it‚Äôs every bit as good and smoky as it looks.
Kaldereta - A Filipino food I love so much is kaldereta, a goat stew, mainly because I love goat so much. It was oily, but really good.
Adobong pusit - I saw the squid the pot and decided to try it out. It was a little on the sweet side.
Pork BBQ - Fresh off the grill, Ying and I ordered some of their pork bbq. The pork was tender and lathered in bbq, it was amazing.

Total price - 640 PHP ($12.90)

If you‚Äôre looking for a local Filipino restaurant in Manila that I think serves some of the best Filipino food, Aling Sosing's is a restaurant you‚Äôre going to want to check out. The food is awesome, the setting and positive atmosphere is refreshing, and the constant smoke from the grill will keep your nose happy and wanting more!

Mombasa is a beautiful city located in Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. It‚Äôs a melting pot of a city, full of culture and delicious food. In this video, I met up with Farhana and Samil, both from Mombasa, and both love to eat.

Lighthouse - First place we headed on this Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa is along the coast called Mama Ngina drive, or Lighthouse. You‚Äôll find an abundance of small snacks along the road with a view over the cliffs of the Indian ocean. Probably my favorite street food was the fried cassava chips, which are fried fresh, put into bags, then seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime juice.

Here are the main street food snacks we had:
Coconut, heart of palm, cassava - 340 KES ($3.33) total
Cassava chips
Roasted and fried cassava
Coconuts
Sweet potato, corn, many things

Next we headed into the heart of Mombasa to eat from a roadside shop selling a mixture of bhajias, fried potatoes, and fried chilies. This is legendary street food in Mombasa! When you order she puts all the fried things onto a plate and douses them in coconut chutney and hot sauce. The combination is delicious, and  my favorite item was the fried chilies.
Bhajia plate combo - 90 KES ($0.88)

Azad Ice Cream - We then had sugarcane juice, a Mombasa Kenyan favorite. They added sugarcane, plus ginger and lime.

Damascus Shawarma - 200 KES ($1.96) - One of the popular food trucks in Mombasa is Damascus shawarma. It was pretty good.

Abbasi Darbar - To finish off this Kenyan food tour of Mombasa, we ended with a  mega meat feast at Abbasi Darbar, a great place to fulfill all your meat needs. We ordered most of what they offer on the menu. Everything was delicious,  but I think the winner for me was the spring chicken tikka.
Total price - 1,900 KES ($18.64)

Again, thank you for Farhana for taking me on this amazing Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa, Kenya. Be sure to check out her channel here:

So, slowly, slowly; we're unraveling a life together, you and I. I talk a lot, and you've become one hell of a great listener. I appreciate that. 

Anna (the younger one) in Peru spoke of her father's favorite poem. Something about how every man has his first kiss and his first snowfall, and it stuck to me, really snugly. And like you, I have mine. I have my stories that make me who I am, that create the fibers that define where I've been, that push me passed the pain to create who I want to be.

But, according to Buddhism, that 'me' is but only an allusion. Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, and it's what we hold onto, to help us define ourselves, label us, categorize and witness our own journey. But, Buddhism teaches that this false sense of self creates boundaries to spirituality and barriers to the true oneness with the world. It's 'me' 'my story' 'my pain' 'my life' and 'you'; likewise, I can stay flapping around lost in the winds of my own self, the way I was, who I was, who I am, who I will be- all false identities I use to mask my true, true non-self, anatta.

Of course, remember there's Gabi the traveler who is spiritual, and Gabi and spiritual who is traveling. I get confused. And, here too, ever so slowly, I'm learning how to differentiate them and know which articles to put here on thenomadicfamily and which ones at gabiklaf. So, if you'd like to learn more about spirituality, finding that peace and inner light, anatta (non-self) and ways to find her- go there to gabiklaf. :-) 

And our tale continues....

So, I have a story. And this blog allows me to share that with you, unraveling meticulously, one glorious string at a time, all the fibers that make me me. So, this is part of my story, my life-long fascination has always been deaf people. I fall in love with them, like I fall in love with people who work in book stores (Sheryl), librarians, Momma and Poppa old-fashion stores (especially with art and writing supplies), and firemen (but that's a whole different like of love, we don't have to get into right now). My entire life, I see someone signing and I'm stuck standing there, a bit too closely, with my jaw dropped and fairy dust parading before my eyes. A deaf person signing is the mute piped piper swaying his hands to the beat of the tune only her hears. He and me. 

So, it all starts like this. Kobi's sitting in the lobby of our hostel here in Siem Reap, Cambodia. He hands me a note (that I still carry in my notebook and look at every few days). It reads: 

""I saw your site, loved it. My friends and I admire you guys for what you all are doing. Keep up with the blog and continue to travel the world! ""

The note comes from Tandy Lewis, Shayna Unger, and Danielle Berrigan. Hand to heart, I look up. Kobi says, ""They're right over there,"" and I was lost in their music from that moment forth. Forget their kind ways, their shining faces and good looks, their interest in their fellow man, their ability to come right out and say kind things to encourage others; THEY ARE DEAF! That's it, deaf, deaf, deaf, and backpacking. 

OMG did my kids see mommy go into this strange metamorphosis. Years before we had kids and during a summer when (I can't recall exactly why) but I don't think I was working on the ice cream trucks; I enrolled in American Sign Language 101. It was an intensive 4-hour a day summer course. Walk in, day one, teacher is deaf. Here we go. 

So, sitting in the lobby in the middle of Cambodia, signing. I touched things that were precious and lost to me. A language I once knew, rather well. A language we had taught our three babies so that they could effectively communicate their needs before their mouth muscles knew how to voice words. We did baby sign in our home for years. 

And, remarkably fast, it came back. I was standing there talking to these amazing ladies, but not really, really there. I was somewhere else that I'd known long ago, but still can't define. I was in that silent world that somehow lights a voice in my soul that reveals a joy I do not know otherwise. It's a weird magic, and one I am grateful for the girls for bringing out again.

Now, Murphy would have it that during the absolutely most endearing (this one or debate ably the 'Angel Outside of Consumerist Hell') interview for me personally, the camera would shut off. So, you only see two minutes of six... Maybe that's meant to show me that my Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, is an allusion, just like my actually recording of this kick-ass, unreal interview was too. 


Enjoy it, and it's brevity. I did.

381,3iRh8dKu99A,25 things to do in Dublin Travel Guide,"So this week we're excited to be exploring Dublin and we're planning to spend an entire week here. This video is going to highlight 25 things to do around the city. Dublin is where most trips in Ireland begin, so before seeing the rest of the country, Audrey and I spent a whole week getting to know the capital. When the weather cooperated we walked around the city, toured Trinity College, and visited the botanical gardens, and when it poured rain as it often does in this part of the world, we just popped into a pub for some Irish stew and a pint of Guinness. The following video will show you a few of the different things to do in Dublin, Ireland.

Our visit Dublin travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts, entertainment, museums, nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Dublin city guide.

25 things to do in Dublin Ireland | Top Attractions Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Trinity College was founded in 1592 and it is the oldest university in Ireland. The campus is open to visitors interested in touring the grounds, and you'll also get to hear some fascinating stories of famous students, including the likes of Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift, and Bram Stoker. 

The Guinness Storehouse is Dublin's most popular attraction, and it's a must-visit for beer lovers. The Storehouse covers seven floors surrounding a glass atrium shaped like a pint of Guinness. Inside you'll also find a copy of the 9,000 year lease signed by Arthur Guinness on the brewery site - they won't be going anywhere for a while!

Grafton Street is one of the main shopping areas in Dublin. You're likely to find lots of musicians, buskers, and performers along here, plus you get a good vantage point of The Spire. 

Prior to the establishment of Glasnevin Cemetery, Irish Catholics had no place of their own to bury their dead. This burial ground gave both Irish Catholics and Protestants a place where they could give their dead dignified burial, and it has since become the resting place for people of all religions and non religions.

Experience Gaelic Games is a place where you can come and try traditional Irish sports like hurling and Gaelic football.

The Old Jameson Distillery is the original site where Jameson Irish Whiskey was distilled until 1971. It is now a visitor centre that offers both guided tours and whiskey tastings.

Temple Bar is an area known for its lively nightlife. Located on the southbank of the River Liffey, you'll find all sorts of pubs playing live music once the sun goes down. There's also one pub in Temple Bar, called The Temple Bar, but don't let that confuse you. 

And that's a wrap for our time in Dublin! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you a few ideas of what the city has to offer. As always, if you have any other suggestions of fun things to do in Dublin as a visitor, feel free to share them in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels!

This is part of our Travel in Ireland series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Irish culture, Irish foods & Irish cuisine.

For Traverse 14 in Newcastle we are looking to go one better and over-deliver in quality workshops, 1-on-1 practical advice and fun networking opportunities. Don't sit on the sidelines, it's time to get involved with Traverse 14.

401,R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: .

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Travel Blogs

408,gGmSLwp-3Z,"Family Travel Blog- New Look at Numbers, Sex, & Manly Wallets- Siem Reap, Cambodia","http://www.thenomadicfamily.com

I know, I know. What in God's name are we talking about now? I know. But it was really interesting how they write their numbers (so cool), and really awkward what to say when your son starts having sex with his fingers in the middle of a restaurant (did I sound cool about it?), and well, Kobi did get a new manly wallet. I love it when men use pink. It just shows that you are man enough to pull it off, being feminine. 

So, it's 2:35 am in Cambodia and you could say I need to go to sleep. I just submitted, per request, my featured article for the largest Israeli online news website, with a million and a half readers a day. OMG! OMG! OMG! For a country with a population of 7 million, with maybe 5 million Jews; a million and a half readers of day is beyond huge. I'm thinking an astounding forth of the people of Israel read this online news source daily, and we're going to be the cover featured article in the Family section for the Jewish New Year! And, maybe we'll get a regular column with them. For an Israeli, this is like the New York Times. Seriously. 

So, I wrote that today and sent it in; and I""m working passionately to write and schedule enough posts to have both blogs running until October 10th. I'll be gone for two weeks from September 11- September 26ish, and we want to have blog blogs securely in place, while I""m gone. What will I be doing you ask?

Getting my spiritual ass kicked into the next life. Ten hours a day of sitting- no writing, talking, walking, sleeping; no, but sitting for ten hours a day and meditating. Dear God, oh the storms of my soul that are about to arise. I await this deep scrubbing with all of my heart, and am terrified from it at the same accord. Can I? How will I? 

I'll let you know when I'm done, and clean.

Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.
Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.

The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.

As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess‚Äô anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",Travel Blogs

It is vibrant, it is exciting, and there's something to do every single night of the week.

We hope this will help showcase some of the sights and attractions this city has to offer, and that it'll come in handy for anyone out there planning a trip. Let's begin!

50 Things to do in London Travel Guide | Top Attractions London City Guide Transcript:

So Hello from London! Time for a new destination. This is a city that I haven't visited in almost 4 years. So we're both very excited to be in London. And we're going to be making a little video guide. Actually a really big video guide because we plan on showing you 50 different things to do around London.

Our first stop was Trafalgar Square. This square leads to a lot of central attractions, so it's a nice place to people watch, get your bearings, and plan out where you want to go in the city. 

The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the Thames. It offers a bird's eye view of the city.

Buckingham Palace has served as the official London residence for Britain's sovereigns since 1837. The State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open to visitors every year.

The Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament, is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Palace along with Big Ben are two of the top London attractions that dot the city-scape.

The Tower of London sits on the north bank of the River Thames. 

And that's a wrap for London! Like with any mega city, it's impossible to cover all the sights and attractions you can enjoy here, but hopefully this video will give you an idea of what London has to offer.

This is part of our Travel in England series showcasing English culture, English foods, English cuisine and English people.

432,Me1SZjWBuoI,Couple Spends 8 Years Living the Van Life & Backpacking Around the World,"Lauren & Craig are a couple of nomads from the UK who have been living the van life and backpacking on only $20 a day for over 8 years.  They've visited over 50 countries so far and don't plan to stop their long term travel streak anytime soon.  

They typically work for 6 months, and then travel for 1 year using the money they earned.  They apply for working holiday visas when visiting Western countries, which is how they manage to work while they travel.  

They also buy camper vans when they visit countries where the accommodation is expensive, which allows them to spend next to nothing on accommodation while living in a van (they sell the van at the end of the trip to make their money back), and they also save money by eating out less and not going out drinking every night.

On average, the couple spends $10 each per day while backpacking and/or when living the van life.  

During their travel time (when they're not working), they go travelling and backpacking in countries where the cost of living is cheap, like India, Nepal, Southeast Asia, Central and South America.

We love this couple's sense of curiosity and adventure, and are excited to follow their blog - Non Stop Travelling - and follow them on Instagram, to live vicariously through them while they explore the world.

GRAB A WOLTERS WORLD SHIRT  http://www.woltersworld.com/shop
What You Shouldn't Do When You Are in Italy 
Visiting Italy is an amazing experience whether you are seeing the Roman ruins throughout the country in places like Rome or Naples, but for all the amazing things you should do in Italy (visit Venice, Florence, Rome, Ravenna, Amalfi Coast, eat until you explode) there are things you DON'T DO when you come to Italy & Here are our 12 things NOT TO DO in Italy when you are traveling Italy. 
Filmed in Vicenza, Italy
Copyright Mark Wolters 2016

The Don'ts of Italy
1. Don't expect to get discount prices on fancy Italian luxury brands. 

2. Don't eat near tourist sights. You will be ripped off and not get as good of Italian food as you would away from the tourist sights. 
 
3. Don't Tip. They already charge you for service. 
4. You Don't have to scream louder to get people to understand you. 
5. Don't worry about overdressing, the Italians will always look better than you.
6. Don't just visit Rome and Venice, there is so much more to Italy. 
7. Don't share your pizza and make sure you do eat it with your fork and knife.
8. Don't use the fast trains for short distances, they are not worth the significantly higher prices. 
9. Don't expect to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu TOGETHER. They will be there separately, but not together. 
10. Don't expect a big breakfast in Italy. Just coffee and a cookie. 
11. Don't overpack. You will be limited on space when traveling in Italy so pack accordingly. 
12. Don't expect to be served food in a restaurant between 3pm and 7pm.

453,AQ6GmpMu5L8,Paris Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Paris.d179898....

Paris, the capital of France, attracts 42 million visitors a year. 

You can start your Paris tour on the metro, on foot, or with a taxi or bicycle; the city is easily navigable on all fronts. Visit the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the city and marvel at its graceful lines and commanding presence. Built between 1806 and 1836, the Arc is one of a number of historical arches and landmarks peppering Paris.

If your Paris sightseeing includes purchasing souvenirs, head to the Champs-√âlys√©es, home of boutique shopping, numerous restaurants, and many bars, along with a theatre and other entertaining venues. Learn about culture and creativity at the Louvre, a 14th-century palace turned art museum, and check in on the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile. Notre Dame Cathedral cannot be missed, as this imposing Gothic structure has stood since 1345.

Speaking of imposing, the Eiffel Tower is most frequently used to represent Paris. Stroll beneath it to get a good idea of its height, or travel to the top for a stunning view of the City of Light. 

Visit our Paris travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

We're traveling along Teuk Chhou Road looking to visit somewhere. We finally decided to visit Veal Pouch waterfall on Bokor Mountain hill. We need to get in the entrance of Veal Pouch Pagoda gate for about 5km. We visit Veal Pouch pagoda and drive a little further to closer and walk about 2km more to Veal Pouch waterfall. It's dry season, there's no water and it's dry stream. We can only visit the empty stream but I have footage of Veal Pouch waterfall during rainy season, it's a big waterfall and amazing. It's hot cuz it's dry season but it's fun to walk. We enjoyed the jungle fruits picked along the road on the hill. We hope to be back to this water during rainy season.

The following are the best 25 things to do in Berlin, Germany presented in our latest city top attractions travel guide:



1) Visit Berlin Wall - The East Side Gallery
2) Brandenburg Gate
3) Tiergarten
4) MauerPark Flohmarkt (MauerPark Flea Market)
5) Friedrichshain
6) Currywurst 
7) Reichstag building 
8) Tempelhof
9) Berlin's Museum Island

11) Charlottenburg Palace 
12) Checkpoint Charlie
13) Alexanderplatz - The Berlin TV Tower 
14) Ritter Sport 
15) Berlin Cathedral
16) Currywurst Museum
17)  Rent a bike and go riding
18) River spree boat tour
19) Eat a Wurst sausage
20) Friedrichshain Flohmarkt (flea market)
21) Eat a German Breakfast
22) Cat Cafe (Pee Pees Katzen Cafe)
23) Schnitzel and Spaetzle
24) U-bahn and S-bahn metro system
25) Turkish Food 

The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin. Today the 1.3 kilometer long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and graffiti. Right now we're visiting Brandenburg Gate.  This gate dates back to the 18th Century. We're here at Tiergarten, one of the biggest parks in the city. MauerPark is a hipster hangout. If you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical performances. If you want to spot some cool street art, then head over to Friedrichshain. You can't come to Berlin and not eat a Currywurst! This is the city's most popular fast food snack. The sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction. Up next we're at the Reichstag building which has a pretty cool glass dome on top.  This dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360 degree views of the city. Today we're visiting Tempelhof, a re-purposed airport here in Berlin for leisure activities and sports. If you enjoy museums and art galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island.  They actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for 18 Euros you get access to all five. We are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.  It is also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Charlottenburg Palace is the largest palace in Berlin and the only surviving royal residence in the city. Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. Located near Alexanderplatz, The Berlin TV Tower offers a great lookout over the city. Chocolate! Ritter Sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany, and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different varieties. Berlin Cathedral is located on Museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. Renting a bike is a great way to get around the city. Most places will rent out bikes at 10 Euros per day. For a leisurely afternoon, hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the River Spree. Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. The Friedrichshain flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing. The Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast, and we recommend you try it too. 
We couldn't resist visiting yet another cat cafe while we were in Berlin. 
While in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of Schnitzel. It's quite easy to get around Berlin using the U-bahn and S-bahn system. In Berlin, there is a big Turkish population and that means there is awesome Turkish street food.  And that's Berlin for you! A city that has risen from the ashes of the war, which is now bursting with art, music, and life. 

Have you been to Berlin? We'd love to hear your favourite things about the city in the comments below.

#12 3D Printing Organs
3D printing has been around for a few years now, but it just recently made breakthroughs bigger than cars or phone cases or toys that have been created before. The 3D printer has started created organs for human use. 
Sure, prosthetics are understandable. But organs? Research is currently being conducted on artificial heart, kidney, and liver structures, as well as other major organs. Organs like the heart will be tougher but it is definitely possible. Can you imagine being the person that kept organs in stock? Checking your list...okay I need to print three kidneys and four livers today. 
The reason the 3D printing works so well is that organs are very complicated and the machine does a layer by layer scan of an actual organ. This allows them to give a very detailed printout.
Crazy yes. But not as crazy as the ability to print out human skin! Now that craziness is happening as we speak! This can be to repair damaged skin or purely cosmetic reasons. 
#11 Needleless Vaccines 
What is your least favorite part of getting flu shots? Oh yeah, the shot. The needle that pierces your skin and stings.
This new invention called the ImmunoMatrix patch will allow you to vaccinate yourself with a simple band-aid like patch. This isn‚Äôt just great because it‚Äôs painless but has even greater benefits. One: It takes a tenth of the vaccine that the syringe does, which saves tons of money. And two: it doesn‚Äôt require the glass vial, syringes, hypodermic needles, trained medical personnel, and biohazardous waste disposal. So again, it saves tons and tons of money.
Can you imagine it being flu season and you just going to town to pick up your flu patch and adhering it at home? Dream big‚Ä¶and realistically! This is happening.
#10 Endless Storage
You know how a terabyte is really big? Well what about a million terabytes? Maybe a trillion? Okay, now imagine an endless amount of storage! 
Scientists at the University of Southampton have created and are working on advances with this technology. Not only will this device store endless info, but it is pretty much invincible to damage.
It is made out of nanostructured glass and has the ability to record and retrieve five dimensional digital data by femtosecond laser writing.
As for right now, it can only hold about 360 TB, but things are quickly escalating there. It can go through almost 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and will last longer than anyone on this planet‚Ä¶except maybe the tardigrade. 
The technology isn‚Äôt for public  use yet because it is reserved for preserving historical documents first, since it can hold an entire library of books! They have already stored actual copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton‚Äôs Opticks, Magna Carta and Kings James Bible. 
#9 Wall Climbing Fish
Ever seen a spider climb a wall? What about a monkey? Hmm‚Ä¶well, what about a wall climbing fish?
In the Amazon rain forest, just recently, a wall climbing fish has been discovered. This may not seem like a scientific advancement, but in reality, it means everything! This isn‚Äôt the only thing odd about these fish, who were oddly enough born in caves only they could see and we‚Äôre colorless! 
This Ecuadorian fish defies gravity as it hikes up a nearly vertical wall for ten feet!
It‚Äôs called a Chaetostoma microps, and is a suckermouth armoured catfish. You‚Äôve seen suckerfish climb underwater, but out of water is a whole new thing! Scientists are ecstatic to study the technique and maybe use it to create wall climbing gear for engineers. 
Another thing that makes this discovery an advancement is that it has never been seen in this exact way before. Meaning, it has either learned the ability on its own, as a species, or‚Ä¶there are still many more species still undiscovered by scientists. 
#8 Cybernetic Implants
The term cyberware is a pretty new field for scientists. Sure, the first pacer was implanted in the 1950s, but that was such a small advancement compared to today. 
We already have an ‚Äúartificial pancreas‚Äù for diabetics. As of now, it is simply a pod implants into the skin by the wearer and pumps insulin into their body. But you see, there are two types of cyberware today.  Brainware and bodyware. You know the datajack from The Matrix? Yeah, like that.

The Franklin Institute offers an electronic presentation of its Case Files, a repository that exists as the documentary record of the Institute's science and technology Awards program. The University of Pennsylvania's Department of History and Sociology of Science hosted a Symposium to discuss the historical, scientific, and educational merit of the Case Files, which date from the 1820s, as a modern day resource for undergraduate, graduate, and professional scholars, as well as K-12 students. The focus of the presentation was on the early history of the computing industry, featuring key individuals including Hollerith, Burroughs, Eckert, Mauchly, Bardeen, Brittain, and Shannon.",Science and Technology

502,dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It‚Äôs an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new ‚Äúthings‚Äù and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ‚Äô90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you‚Äôre a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we‚Äôre being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we‚Äôre not exaggerating at all.

Shocking Secrets Of The Ancient Vedic Science Revealed!

The Vedic civilization, according to the ancient scriptures, was at a much higher level of development than our modern society.

In Sanskrit ‚Äúveda‚Äù means knowledge. So what kind of knowledge are we talking about?

From the standpoint of current evolutionary theory, the human race is supposed to be at the top of the society development. However, according to the Vedic literature, in a distant past there have been civilizations in the world, the greatness of which we cannot even imagine.

A detailed study of the Vedic texts was held in Bombay in 1975.

It was a scientific ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù in physicist circles when the scientists have discovered the vivid description of subatomic level in the Vedas written some five thousand years ago.

The Mahabharata, an ancient historical epic, describes the use of nuclear weapons as follows:

‚ÄúIt was as if all the nature‚Äôs forces have been suddenly unleashed. Something dazzling like the sun revolved in circles. Burned with a heat of this weapon, the world was staggering, as in a fever.

Elephants caught fire from the heat and rushed wildly hither and thither in search of protection from the terrible power. Water in the sea turned hot, the animals were dying, the foes were killed and trees were falling in rows under the fury of the forest fire. Elephants blew their trunks fiercely and fell dead on the ground. Horses and chariots were burned on the spot.

Thus, thousands of enemy chariots were destroyed, and then deep silence descended on the sea. Wind began to blow and the earth shined. It was a terrible sight. The corpses of the fallen were mutilated by terrible heat so that they no longer resembled people. Never before have we seen such a terrible weapon and did not hear about it. ‚Äù (Drona-parva)

The Vedic texts contain a large number of descriptions of different types of weapons, ranging from primitive stone throwing slings (sarvatobhadra), wall smashing mechanisms (udghatima), to all sorts of high velocity dart throwing devices (yantra-sara), and ending with weapons which damaging force does not have modern analogues.

The tenth canto of Bhagavata Purana describes the various battles with weapons of extraordinary power. Those battles were fought by our ancient ancestors inhabited the planet, as well as representatives from other worlds.

It is obvious that our ancestors were much more highly developed than we are today. Comparing to them we look like babies, at least in technical terms.

It appeared that the city was well-protected even in terms of today‚Äôs scientific advancement.

In Vedic literature there are many references to flying saucers. In general, they are called the vimana. Vimanas in the Vedas are divided into two categories:

1) the mechanical machines, similar to airplanes and flying with wings like a bird;

2) and very complex machines that can not be precisely classified, which had unlimited possibilities.

Machines of the first category are described mainly in medieval writings in Sanskrit, along with other various automatic devices and military machines.

There were robots designed in the form of male and female figures that performed various functions. They were made mostly of wood, but perfectly covered with humanlike skin. Their motions were provided by the system of bolts, iron rods, springs and grooves. These figures played musical instruments, served drinks to guests and did other similar services.

Yantrapurusha or man-machine could behave exactly like a real human. It is described in Bhagaya-vastu how an artist visited home of the yantracharya, or a teacher of mechanical engineering. There he was met by a robot-girl who washed his feet and had a resemblance of a real person until he realized that she was unable to speak. However, it is known that there were even speaking and absolutely fantastic sounding robots.
Are we able now, with all our modern science and computer technology, to repeat a similar level of inventive skill? Can we believe that the technical progress, as it is described in the Vedas, has really existed on Earth? Are Sanskrit texts the only proof of greatness of that ancient civilization?",Science and Technology
515,RxmzCJug9HE,Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT,"Disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community‚Äôs ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities, but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.

Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology‚Äôs (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai‚Äôs research interests are social vulnerability analysis, megacity and urban risk, and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI), he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul, Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.

520,X5fhVLJs9g,William Johnson | Science and Technology of Metallic Glasses,"Metallic glasses are vitrified metal alloys ‚Äì liquid alloys that solidify without crystallizing. Like silicate glasses and thermoplastic polymers, they exhibit a glass transition below which the liquid freezes to a solid that resists shear on practical time scales. Bulk metallic glasses developed over the past two decades, exhibit unique thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties that make them an attractive choice for numerous engineering applications. Their glassy nature opens processing and manufacturing opportunities normally associated with plastics technology. The speaker will survey the scientific and technological evolution of metallic glasses from their inception to the present time. He will describe how metallic glass technology offers unique opportunities to change the way metals are used and commercial metal products are manufactured.

William L. Johnson, the Ruben and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science at Caltech, joined the Caltech faculty in 1977. He received his B.A. in physics from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Caltech. He spent two years at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center (1975-77) prior to joining the faculty at Caltech.
Professor Johnson's research interests are centered on non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. His research advisor was Pol Duwez, the inventor of metallic glass. In the mid-1980's, he, along with Ricardo Schwarz, discovered solid-state amorphization, leading to many years of fruitful research. His research accomplishments include the first studies of superconductivity in metallic glasses, pioneering studies of crystal to glass transformations (see Progress in Materials Science, 30, 81-134 (1986)) and seminal work on the application of thermodynamics to ion beam induced modifications of materials (Nucl. Instr. & Methods, B7, 657 (1985)).
This work was followed by the synthesis of nanocrystalline and amorphous materials by high energy ball milling, and, in 1993, the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. Professor Johnson has pioneered the discovery, characterization and science of bulk metallic glass forming alloys and their use as engineering materials (see, for example, Applied Phys. Letters, 63, 2342 (1993)). His recent work has involved the development of a theory that establishes fundamental physical principles governing flow in amorphous materials. His research group is continuing to discover new bulk metallic glass forming alloys employing both experimental methods and molecular dynamic simulations to predict potential glass-forming candidates.
The discovery of new glass-forming alloys cascades into a chain of scientific investigations, including the measurement of thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical and viscous properties; fundamental research into the kinetics of crystallization and glass formation, and improving the properties of monolithic bulk metallic glass through the fabricaiton of intrinsically and extrinsically toughened composites.

His research has lead to commercial success, too. He is an inventor on over 25 issued patents. He is a cofounder of Liquidmetal Technologies, in Lake Forrest California, which commercialized one of Professor Johnson's BMG alloys for golf club heads (under the company name ""LiquidMetal Golf""). The company is now pursuing opportunities in cases for electronic devices. They are also expanding into the defense industry, as some of the BMG composites have demonstrated properties superior to depleted uranium as high-velocity penetrators.
Professor Johnson served on the editorial board of the Journal of Rapid Solidification, and serves currently as an associate editor for Journal of Applied Physics, and Applied Physics Letters. He is a principal editor of the MRS Journal of Material Science. He is author or co-author of over 230 publications in the scientific literature, and has contributed chapters to seven books. He has held numerous consulting positions for the Department of Energy, NASA, and corporations. Over the past two decades, he has been a consultant and on numerous advisory panels for the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Engineering.",Science and Technology

You‚Äôd be surprised to find out what crazy inventions existed back then that science still can‚Äôt explain today.  If you‚Äôre ready to learn more about these mind-blowing ancient inventions plus a whole lot more, then keep on watching.

SUMMARY
-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.
-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid‚Äôs toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.
-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.
-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.
-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that‚Äôs because they were the best swords at the time.
-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn‚Äôt more.
-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn‚Äôt come around until 800 years later.
-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.
-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth‚Äôs movements.
-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first analog computer‚Äù and it was made around 200 B.C.E.

  * ""Metallurgical Engineering""
Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys. Metallurgy is also the technology of metals: the way in which science is applied to the production of metals, and the engineering of metal components for usage in products for consumers and manufacturers. The production of metals involves the processing of ores to extract the metal they contain, and the mixture of metals, sometimes with other elements, to produce alloys. Metallurgy is distinguished from the craft of metalworking, although metalworking relies on metallurgy, as medicine relies on medical science, for technical advancement...",Science and Technology

583,05EYl-v1_L,SHANGHAI FAKE MARKETS - SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY - CHINA ARIL 2017,"Shanghai Fake Markets @ Science and Technology on Subway Line 2.
Inside of the metro stop is where the fake markets are located. They're are tons of stores, its easy to forget where you started and if you had been where you are already. Most stores will tell you a very ridiculous price at first you just have to tell them to make it what you would like to pay and maybe walk away and they will defiantly being it down. If you know any Chinese speak in Chinese and they won't tell you a crazy price because they think that you might live in china and you know better. They are a lot of stores with the same stuff, so before you buy something check it out in multiple stores so you know your getting the best one and the best price. They have some really cool stuff here, especially if you take your time a look through all the little stores you'll find some really cool stuff not just fake clothes or shoes. THANKS FOR WATCHING 


WATCH THIS: 





Tips 


1. Walk away if they won't bring down price and they will bring it lower immediately.

2. Tell them you'll look in another store, they will also bring it down immediately.

3. Don't let them tell you anything is real, it's all fake.

4. Look in multiple stores before you pick something they're are hundreds of stores selling the same things.

IbakiraTV: https://www.youtube.com/ibaraki

The local government in Ibaraki gave us free reign for three days to film whatever places we wanted, and our second stop was Science Square Tsukuba, a showcase of the cutting edge technologies being researched at AIST (The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology). There were A LOT of displays! We mainly filmed the areas that were somewhat interactive to make for a more engaging video, but there was a lot of really interesting information on what technologies are being developed right now! There's information in English on touchscreens next to all the displays and it is not dumbed down for anyone! I super recommend this center if you love science and technology.

This is part of Tsukuba Science City, which is a planned city in Japan that aggregates scientific academies, research institutions, museums, and even JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency--Japan's version of NASA). It's right next to the geology museum, and a few blocks away is Tsukuba Expo Center, the site of the 1985 Science Exposition. It now hosts Japan's largest observatory and planetarium. And right near that is the Tsukuba Space Center, one of Tsukuba's most popular attractions. If you're into science and technology at all, Tsukuba Science City is a must!!

608,xLXOrXd5Bl4,History of Food Science & Technology [For Beginners],"Do you know that most of the food we see on the shelf of the supermarkets today, wasn‚Äôt available a 100-150 years from now?
 
This was because there were very few techniques to preserve the food. The food would spoil very fast and a lot of people suffered from food poisoning and even death. 
The food we eat today, is completely taken for granted because it is cheap and easily available. 
The food you and I are eating today has been possible because of the efforts of a lot of scientists, researchers, engineers, food technologists, nutritionists so that the food you are eating is safe and healthy. 

But the process of developing food wasn‚Äôt invented overnight. So, what is the history and how food technology originated?

Well if you ask me, I think the preservation of food has been abundant since early human started farming. Early humans realized the fact that they could not always hunt for animals or pluck fruits from trees every day. 

And if they stored the food like meat, it spoiled very fast. So, they had to develop some preservation techniques for eating the food even when they could not hunt, or the fruits and vegetables weren‚Äôt available.

Some of the earliest preservation techniques include Sun-Drying, freezing, salting, fermentation and so on. The downside of the early preservation techniques was that they changed the flavour and texture of the food along with huge loss of vitamins most of the time. 

These techniques were not very effective for travellers and soldiers who needed a healthy diet. 

During the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815), the French Government offered 12,000 Francs to anyone who could develop a method for preserving food for the military. 

In 1809, a French confectioner and chef developed a method of sealing the food in glass jars. The name of that French man was ‚ÄòNicholas Appert‚Äô. The process was simple. He sealed the food in a glass jar and then heated the jar for some time depending upon the food. The method proved to be successful and he was awarded 12,000 Francs. 

The invention of canning is considered as the major turning point in the history of food technology and food science. Because of his remarkable contribution, Nicholas Appert is also known as the ‚ÄòFather of Canning‚Äô. And even canning is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄòAppertization‚Äô. 

Although canning was successful but the science behind its success wasn‚Äôt known until 50 years later, when a French microbiologist and chemist showed that growth of micro-organisms is responsible for the spoilage of beverages. 

He also invented a process where milk was heated to a specific temperature for a specified time to kill the spoilage micro-organisms. That French microbiologist was none other than Louis Pasteur. 
The process he invented is still prevalent in the dairy industry and wine industry as well. And in the honour of Louis Pasteur, the process is known as ‚ÄòPasteurization‚Äô. 

In 1895, almost a 30 years later in Boston, Massachusetts, William Lyman Underwood of a canning company worked with Samuel Prescott to develop the research which would further lead to the concept of ‚ÄòThermal Death Time‚Äô. 

A lot of people don‚Äôt consider this event when it comes to the history of food technology, but this was also one of the turning points in the history as their research was important to determine the time-temperature combination for a food. That means, for how long a food will be cooked at what temperature. 

Since then, a lot of research and discoveries had been done but in the 20th century, food safety was still an issue. 

In 1960, the Pillsbury company, NASA and the USA army labs collaborated to develop safe and healthy food for the astronauts. 
Eventually, they developed a systematic preventive approach to ensure food safety and that came to be known as ‚ÄòHACCP‚Äô. 

HACCP is a preventive tool used in food industry to ensure safety of the food.
HACCP is prevalent today in every food industry and food safety is incomplete without the implementation of the HACCP program. 

Since the development of HACCP, there have been a lot of rapid growth in the food technology. Industrialists have adopted newer technologies to process the food in a faster and efficient way. 
So, these were some of the major breakthroughs in the history of food technology.

Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.
The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

633,JvNTQ6R-9GU,What is STS? - Science and Technology Studies at UCL,"STS, or Science and Technology Studies, is an exciting and growing field of study - but what does STS actually involve? Where would a degree in STS take you?

STS combines history of science, philosophy of science, sociology of science, science policy, science communication and other fields into one combined field of study. We look at how science shapes the world, and how the world shapes science - and we use approaches from the humanities to understand how science interacts with society. 

UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies offers two undergraduate degrees. History and Philosophy of Science, and (new for 2019) Sociology and Politics of Science - as well as MSc and PhD level study.

Interested in finding out more? Watch some of our other videos where we look at specific examples, discuss the modules on offer from our department, or watch our JBS Haldane public lecture series to really get a feel for what a degree in STS would be like.

Have you ever watched a cartoon snowball roll down a hill? It usually picks up snow on its way down, getting larger and larger, before inevitably running over someone. In many ways, the advancement of science and technology since World War II (WWII) has acted a lot like that snowball - out of a few small technological developments and breakthroughs has come even more innovation and new devices which seem to come to market at a faster pace every day. It's how we can go from adding machines the size of an apartment to handheld computers in barely a half century. This lesson will detail some of these mind-boggling advances in the world of science and technology since WWII.
Communications

Communications and the dissemination of information is so ubiquitous now that we hardly even realize the constant flow of information hitting us. Prior to WWII, the main form of household communications device most people had in their homes was the radio. Televisions existed, but they were generally very expensive and the programming options were very few. The television exploded in popularity in the 1950s, allowing people to watch important events as they happened in real time.

For example, many Americans watched Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon in 1969 from the comfort of their own couch. Likewise, the televised 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II allowed many British residents to see the pomp and circumstance surrounding a royal coronation for the first time.

As the decades wore on, television technology became better and better as color televisions largely replaced the original black-and-white sets in the 1970s. Accessories such as video cassette recorders (VCRs) proliferated as screens got larger and the definitions became crisper. In the 1990s, high definition (HD) televisions hit the market which produced a markedly more crisp and vibrant picture than before, though it took approximately a decade before HD televisions became household items in the United States.

Telephones also experienced a similarly accelerated increase in use and technological development after WWII. From its invention by Alexander Graham Bell in the late 19th century, the telephone grew increasingly popular and largely replaced the telegraph by WWII, with approximately 30 million phones in service by 1948. After WWII, telephone use continued to expand quickly and by the 1970s over 100 million phones were in use.

The next major advancement in telephone communication came in the 1990s with the proliferation of the cellular phone. Though portable and in-vehicle phones had been experimented with since the 1940s, the first true cellular phones (that is, one that pedestrians could carry with them) did not arrive until the 1980s, and even then they were relatively large, clunky objects and were too expensive for the average person. This changed in the 1990s as cell phones got smaller, faster, and cheaper.

The proliferation of text messaging in the early 2000s turned the cellular phone into a multi-use tool. The creation of the smartphone, and most notably Apple's iPhone, which essentially turned the cell phone into a computer as well, has completely changed the cell phone, putting access to a world of information on a device which only a couple decades ago was used merely for making telephone calls.
Transportation

The world of transportation has seen similar improvements in technology since WWII, though not nearly the same level of innovation. Indeed, our main modes of transportation - automobile, airplane, train, or ship - are still the same, though they have all undergone serious transformations to improve safety and efficiency.

The world of automobiles, for example, remained largely unchanged for the first century of its existence, but in the past quarter century, environmental awareness and the high price of oil and gasoline has spurred research and development in cars fueled by alternative sources of fuel. All major auto companies now either have an electric car being developed or on the road, and all have successful gas/electric hybrid models, such as the Toyota Prius or the Ford Fusion Hybrid.

Air travel has made more significant advances since WWII with the advent of the jet engine in the 1950s. Prior to the jet engine, all planes were prop-engines, which used large propellers to generate the speed and air flow over the wings necessary for flight. The jet engine provided enormous amounts of thrust, which made the propeller obsolete, though it should be noted many prop planes are still in service today.

With the jet engine, planes could now fly farther and faster and carry larger loads. Since WWII commercial air travel has exploded in popularity and safety on airlines has gotten increasingly better - as of this writing in early 2014, the United States' domestic airlines (think Delta, United, or American Airlines) have gone over four years without a major crash.",Science and Technology

Lecture Abstract:  
As human population is growing faster than ever, access to reliable and sustainable energy has become one of the most important problems in the 21st century. Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.

When you think of the word ""robot,"" you probably picture social 'bots like Rosie, the Jetson's maid, and Star Wars' C-3PO. Cynthia Breazeal, an Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, is working to make your humanoid robot dreams a reality. Dr. Breazeal is the founder and director of the Personal Robots Group at MIT's Media Lab, a program that develops the techniques and technologies necessary to develop personal robots.

Her most famous robot is Kismet, the first robot designed to engage humans in expressive, natural interactions. Kismet, built as part of Breazeal's doctoral thesis at MIT, was dubbed one of the ""50 Best Robots Ever"" by Wired Magazine in 2006. Other robots emerging from Breazeal's lab include Leonardo, another expressive robot; Autom, a robot designed to help people lose weight; and RoCo, a robotic computer that can adjust its ""posture."" So if you see a friendly robot walking down the street 20 years from now, Breazeal might be partially to thank. ‚ÄîAriel Schwartz

Abstract: Let's face it: most scientists are terrible communicators. Why do the world's most cerebral people find it so hard to convey their ideas? And how can we learn to do better? I suggest that answers can be found in a number of ideas from the modern sciences of mind and language. Among them are: The Tree and the Chain (how multidimensional ideas are mapped onto one-dimensional strings); The Curse of Knowledge (why it's so hard to imagine what it's like not to know something you do know); and Long Shadow of Mrs. Grundy (how to distinguish rules of proper usage that are worth keeping from those that are bogus)

694,_RV-ITIYpAE,Creative Processes in Science and Technology: Insights from,"Google Tech Talk
May 14, 2009

ABSTRACT

Creative Processes in Science and Technology: Insights from Visual Arts.  Presented by Dr. Julio M. Ottino.

Creativity is essential in art, in science, and in technology. But in what way is creativity different in these three areas, and in what way is it similar? Technology is about invention, making and building; science is about unveiling, revealing what may already be there. Philosophers, placing the emphasis on uniqueness, have declared that science is ephemeral and that art is permanent, and have placed artistic creation on the highest plane. Others have taken the same viewpoint. However, is this actually true? Or more pragmatically, are there creative processes and lessons that can be transferred across domains? In what ways do the domains intersect and enrich each other? Julio M. Ottino argues that artistic creativity reveals processes that hold lessons for scientific and technological creativity. 

Dr. Julio M. Ottino is the dean of the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Northwestern University where he holds the titles of Distinguished Robert R. McCormick Institute Professor and Walter P. Murphy Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Born in Argentina he had a career as an artist before he moved to the U.S. for his PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He then held a faculty position at UMass/Amherst and held chaired and senior appointments at Caltech, Stanford, and the University of Minnesota. He joined Northwestern in 1991 and was chairman of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering from 1992 to 2000. He was the founder and co-director of the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems.",Science and Technology

696,f_qq-hX3QM,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Part 1 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.

Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.

HKUST has modern buildings, it has a very modern large campus, compared to the other Asian universities like NTU, HKU. It has a beautiful campus, right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea, they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well, half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year, including 800 students in the Engineering School.

One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you have done IB, ICSE or CBSE, everyone can get a scholarship, only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early, a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.

The cost is around HKD 120,000 for international students and HKD 40,000 for local students. The government funds each child, whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong ‚Äì approx. HKD 15,000 ‚Äì 20,000 per year which is very low.

Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options, you can do three courses in one area to call that your option, he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math, comp science, history, science and technology ‚Äì any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.
Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.
The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse ‚Äì he is the financial secretary of the art club, the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit, as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. 
HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.
HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too, they have a football field, running track near the sea, an indoor football court too, 8 tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, indoor gym, table tennis tables, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, multi purpose hall for martial arts.  
Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded, 10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience. There are students from all around the world. Also the 80% Hong Kong students are diverse. They could be from all over the world but grew up in Hong Kong and are classified as Hong Kong Locals.

Hello friends, scientists put in lots of efforts to develop new technology for the betterment of human civilization. Beauty of Science is that all the analysis and investigation helps advance humans in technology and provide a better lifestyle to the people. So can you imagine how unreal and unbelievable would our future world look like due to rapid scientific advancement in fields like biology, medical science, chemistry, physics, cosmology, space research. But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt always go that way because government and politicians try to suppress mankind‚Äôs invention and potential technology. In past technologies like digital cameras, free electricity, weather technology, electric cars etc were tried to supress. How would our future be like if we had all this technology in upcoming future.
Will we be able colonize different planets in our universe, what robots and nono bots we‚Äôll use to carry out computer operations, medical procedures etc. The future of the world is indeed truly amazing, kinda loaded with sci-fi new tech and many diseases would also be cured thereby increasing life expectancy of humans. Watch the entire video in hindi to know which technologies were hidden! -

We will focus on advancing technology solutions along five strategic capabilities. To move the Air Force from a current force challenged by increasingly sophisticated adversaries to a force that dominates time, space and complexity in future conflict.

Global persistent awareness, resilient information sharing, rapid effective decision making, complexity, unpredictability in mass, speed and reach of disruption and lethality ‚Äì those concepts must drive our research as they drive our way to fight.

Welcome to Smart-Glasses.org! We are proud to provide information and resources about smart glasses and smart technology. We hope you find the information provided here useful as we continue to explore new emerging technology.

Once the realm of science fiction movies, computer technology has moved to glasses, and multiple companies are making plans for this emerging mobile peripheral wireless market. The first smart glasses are projected to be available in the summer to fall of 2012 with other companies potentially releasing their versions by the end of 2012. Smart glasses will incorporate a bright high-definition display, adjustable for outdoor use on the glass lens so that the images appear as if they were in the exterior world. They will also have Internet connectivity and multiple new applications. Some of the displayed images will have a holographic quality to them, depending upon the smart glass manufacturer, making the image appear as if it were real and in front of the smart glasses

2)leap motion:-
The Leap Motion controller is a small USB peripheral device which is designed to be placed on a physical desktop, facing upward. Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LEDs, the device observes a roughly hemispherical area, to a distance of about 1 meter (3 feet). The LEDs generate a 3D pattern of dots of IR light[14] and the cameras generate almost 300 frames per second of reflected data, which is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer, where it is analyzed by the Leap Motion controller software using ""complex math"" in a way that has not been disclosed by the company, in some way synthesizing 3D position data by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras.[15][16]
The smaller observation area and higher resolution of the device differentiates the product from the Kinect, which is more suitable for whole-body tracking in a space the size of a living room.[17] In a demonstration to CNET, The Leap was shown to perform tasks such as navigating a website, using pinch-to-zoom gestures on maps, high-precision drawing, and manipulating complex 3D data visualizations.[17] Leap Motion CEO Michael Buckwald told CNET:
Leap Motion initially distributed thousands of units to developers who are interested in creating applications for the device. The Leap Motion controller was first shipped in July, 2013

3)3D printing :-
3D printing or Additive manufacturing[1] is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes.[2] 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes).
A 3D printer is a limited type of industrial robot that is capable of carrying out an additive process under computer control.
While 3D printing technology has been around since the 1980s, it was not until the early 2010s that the printers became widely available commercially.[3] The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp.[4] Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of these machines, and their price has dropped substantially.[5] According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011.[6]
The 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in architecture, construction (AEC), industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military,

Which begs the question: ""Will the iPhone 5 have the same CPU - or an A5?"" A patent search does reveal that Apple is the owner of five patents of the macroscalar processor architecture. The latest is 8,065,502 and is dated November 22, 2011. Apple may even hold the copyright on the term as it appears to be new to our language.

What did the Romans do for us?

They invented the modern world.  Modern cities, modern warfare, modern living all first came together in ancient Rome.  The Romans were the first superpower, controlling around a quarter of the world‚Äôs population.  This film looks at how they used technology to hold together their empire.  We see the ingenious pilum, a spear cleverly designed so that the enemy couldn‚Äôt throw it back; the scorpion, a bolt-firing weapon of war; and the rock-hurling ballista, the fore-runner of modern artillery.

We learn how they built their roads, the arteries of the empire that, put end to end, would stretch twice around the world.  Roman cities, with their grid pattern, paved the way for the cities of today.  They had hot baths, central heating, flushing toilets and double-glazing.  They built apartment blocks 8 stories high, and to entertain their citizens built stunning buildings like the Pantheon and Colosseum (or Coliseum).  But holding everything together at the heart of the Empire, was water.  No city can survive without a supply of drinking water.  Great aqueducts carried water into Rome from springs 11 miles away.  When the planners of New York were building their water system, they travelled to Italy to copy the Romans.",Science and Technology

The awards, formerly known as the National Science and Technology Awards since 1987, have been elevated to the status of the President's awards to highlight and give due recognition to the important role research scientists and engineers play in Singapore. The prestige of the President's awards underpins Singapore's efforts to raise the level of excellence in research and strengthen the growing community of scientific talent in Singapore. 

The President's Science and Technology Awards constitute three different awards, namely, the President's Science and Technology Medal, the President's Science Award and the President's Technology Award. The winners of the respective awards have been carefully chosen through a rigorous process by a selection committee comprising key representatives from the government, industry, academia, defence and public research institutes.

794,4u3f7_p1i8,Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field,"John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India, 20 February, 2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.

Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern World

Vedic Science is scientific, practical, and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.

Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.

Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life‚Äîthe field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.

Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.

Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature‚Äôs functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.

Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well‚Äîthe self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.

This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.

The process of transcending‚Äîmoving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)‚Äîprovides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.

Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)‚Äîthe union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.

This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a ‚Äúwakeful hypo-metabolic state‚Äù of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.

Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.

Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects. Thus the Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.",Science and Technology

807,Eo76-SX5Bck,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology - Part 2 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 2 of 2 videos.

Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.

Coming to Jobs, another advantage of studying in Hong Kong is availability of Jobs, visa, internships etc. Ansh says that jobs in Hong Kong pay a lot, some students can pay their living expenses because of a well-paying job. Most common part time job for students is to become a tutor for other IB students, and this is very well paying and helps take care of boarding and living expenses.
The language requirement for most jobs is English, though they prefer if you know Cantonese. However, there are many students who have well-paying jobs without knowing Chinese. It is very easy to get a work visa once you have studied there, also the job placements are very good. Most international students have job offers in hand a few months before they graduate and very good salaries.
Intense research culture, jobs being available, salaries being good, visas being easily available and cost being low make it a very attractive place to study in.
Asian culture is unique and different from the American and British universities. They are very academic and it is very difficult to score good grades. Students are graded on a curve and it is very tough to get a GPA over 3.0. The Chinese students spend most of their time studying and for them university is about studying. If they pursue any activity they will take up only one activity and pursue it very seriously. They are much focussed.
There is no fraternity culture, there are clubs and societies, though international students are not welcome for most of these. The language is mostly in Chinese. At the Business school lectures are discussion based. In Engineering school there are less international professors, there are more Chinese professors. In their culture subordination is key. Professors at the top, students below. So you are not supposed to question a professor in class. If you give the right answer in class, they think you are showing off. Students don‚Äôt like to speak in class.
Language of Instruction is English, but given 80% Cantonese. Most activities are conducted in Cantonese like clubs, movie nights, trekking activities etc. are all conducted in Cantonese. Most students have learnt English but they find it very difficult to speak in English since English is either their second or third language. So they prefer sticking amongst themselves. Even if they know how to speak in English they are very reluctant, since in their culture if you make a mistake people make fun of you, so they are afraid that the international students will make fun of them so they prefer to speak in Cantonese.
Ansh started learning Cantonese to merge with them, and that made a big difference since they found an international student is trying to learn Cantonese and trying to speak with us, they get more friendly with you. Even with sports, may Indian students do not participate in sports, they are usually more involved in partying or studying. Ansh is one of the few international students who is serious about his extra curriculars. Even mainland Chinese students have always studied in Mandarin so most of them learn English just before coming to college, just to get admission.
The food on campus is local Chinese food that is not very spicy. Food places outside campus can be quite expensive. Ansh travelled around Hong Kong researching good food less than HKD 50 or 100. HE enjoyed the food since Hong Kong is a very diverse place for food, a huge varieties of cuisines. He now tries to cook his own food and became the director of the cuisine society to initiate more activities with people who are as passionate about food.    
The social scene on campus is also very different. Their idea of partying is not drinking and dancing but playing games and eating good food. So most International students go out for partying. In Hong Kong the two main partying areas are Wanchai and Lan Kwan Fong, both have a very international feel, where many international students party. 
Hiking is a great fun activity in Hong Kong. You can hike in the middle of the city, in five minutes you can be from a station to a mountain. There are hiking trails and maps available which make hiking a great activity in Hong Kong.  
‚ÄòCrazy‚Äô is the one word in which he describes his school ‚Äì crazy academic and crazy diverse.

830,zdg5iovYR1I,European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) - what's in it for researchers?,"The nature of science has changed. It has become interconnected, collaborative, multidisciplinary and data-intensive.

The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) has been a building block of Europe's research for 45 years. It funds research networks across borders and spanning all scientific disciplines. 

Because science is all about people, COST creates spaces where people are empowered and ideas can grow without limits. It connects people in high-quality networks that deliver value for money and opportunities to excel. This is a flexible and open approach focused on cooperation, which creates a unique dynamic. It creates a fertile ground for science to flourish. 

Academia, industry, public and private sector laboratories work together in networks, sharing knowledge, leveraging diversity and pooling resources.

COST is now more relevant than ever. It is the perfect example of how governments can make a real difference, ensuring that cooperation optimises national investment in research and technology and unlocks the full potential of science.

India is one of the oldest and richest civilizations in the world. It is home to the world's first planned cities, where every house had its own bathroom and toilet five thousand years ago. The Ancient Indians have not only given us yoga, meditation and complementary medicines, but they have furthered our knowledge of science, maths - and invented Chaturanga, which became the game of chess.
According to Albert Einstein, they ""taught us how to count"", as they invented the numbers 1-9 and 'zero', without which there would be no computers or digital age. Unfairly we call this system of counting Arabic numbers - a misplaced credit.
Two thousand years ago the Indians pioneered plastic surgery, reconstructing the noses and ears on the faces of people who had been disfigured through punishment or warfare. They performed eye operations such as cataract removal and invented inoculation to protect their population from Smallpox, saving thousands of lives.",Science and Technology

As the Canadian Senate reaches the deadline for a third vote on Bill C45/46, The Cannabis Act, committee hearings to explore the issue offer a painfully frustrating view into how laws reach royal assent.

Seemingly ignorant of their own report from 2002, which recommended a legal age for cannabis purchase at 16, Senators continue to use the incarceration of peaceful, non-violent citizens for political ends.

Thankfully the day finished with some level-headed opinions, most notably from John Conroy. When asked about the harms of cannabis on youth, Conroy replies simply, 'what is the harm to youth from being arrested?'

Speakers on April 30th, 2018 included:

Starfire is a regional organization that works to build better lives for people with disabilities. The idea for this event came from a young man named Craig Ihlendorf, who is passionate about all things science.

""I came up with edible chemistry which is -- when you're cooking food, you're actually doing chemistry, but the difference is you can eat it,"" Ihlendorf said.

To power the boat we attached two motors that spin in opposite directions, with a propeller each.

After the first test we noticed that the boat spun around rather than going in a straight line.

870,GCXhdAGx3NI,Future Predictions - Food Technology and Science,"How will our food be made in the future? From hydroponics to gene editing, technology is helping feed our ever-growing population. 

We‚Äôre here to give you a sneak peek of what food production will look like in years to come. So, how is technology going to help farmers produce our food?

Precision farming and the application of diagnostics and sensor technologies will keep food production affordable. More data will be available to farmers to help inform decision making for things like veterinary medicines and the use of crop protection products. 

How can we ensure we have enough food for everyone?

New approaches like vertical farming can increase crops yields by five hundred percent. If we can use those with hydroponic systems, we won‚Äôt need to farm with soil so we can grow crops in new environments like brownfield sites or in cities. 

We can also look at LED lighting to make specific light recipes which can be tailored to different crop varieties to further optimise yields and quality.

Presumably, these won‚Äôt need the same conditions as ‚Äòregular‚Äô crops?

They‚Äôll be able to grow crops all year round. We can also deploy these systems in extreme environments or in remote communities to help reduce their reliance on food imports. 

So overall, crop yields and quality will increase. The nutritional value of the crops will increase and precision farming applications can help to increase animal health and welfare and also to reduce the environmental impact of food production.

Will we notice any changes in what appears on our plates?

Globally we‚Äôre seeing an increase in demand for protein. In China and India there‚Äôs increase consumption of meat and dairy products, whilst in Europe there‚Äôs interest in vegetable based proteins and how we can make these more appealing to meat eaters. We‚Äôll also see opportunities to farm insects for things like animal food but also potentially human food as well.

Are people going to be onboard with eating insects though? 

People probably more used to western diets would find them unpalatable, but we could see opportunities to use ground insect protein in things like protein bars or incorporated into flours. We can also see opportunities to use insects in animal feed applications as a natural source of protein. 

What about people with allergies or intolerances?

New technologies like gene editing are used to make crops that meet specific needs, like allergen-free foods or food products with better health benefits to manage diet-related diseases.

878,ZX8kJfWzvX4,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),"Located in the science and research hub of Daedeok Innopolis in Daejeon, South Korea, the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed into an active institution, often placed among some leading universities in global scientific education and research.

KAIST has connotations of academic excellence, innovation and entrepreneurship, but also the launch of large-scale projects. The university often ranks highly among other universities of a similar age.

KAIST was established in February 1971 as Korea Advanced Institute of Science, with a loan given by United States Agency for International Development. The university aimed not only to educate young researchers in science and engineering, but also to provide a solid basis for the development of future higher education institutions in Korea.

Its structure was created by an international team, which included the American electrical engineer and vice-president of Stanford University Frederick Emmons Terman. Unlike other public institutions in South Korea, KAIST has freedom to decide upon its entry requirements and course structure, which gives the university a special status.

Today, KAIST has a rich academic portfolio in disciplines such as physics, mathematics, engineering, humanities and social sciences, business and management. The courses are delivered by 6 colleges and 2 schools, with over 33 divisions. KAIST‚Äôs unique institutes include the National NanoFab Center, which conducts research into nano-devices and their potential applications.

KAIST consists of 2 major campuses situated in Daejeon and South Korea‚Äôs capital Seoul. They offer over 25 dormitories, 4 libraries and a medical centre. To ensure students are actively engaged in the campus cultural events, the university organises traditional opera and jazz recitals.

Some of the most famous KAIST former faculty members and graduates are the electrical engineer Soon-dal Choi, mathematician Gi-hyong Gho and the physicist Chang Hee Nam.

900,V66feYKy6_A,"Stephen Hawking: Science & Technology Lecture, Interview - Education (1998)","Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. His books: 

His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Hawking is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.

Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his book A Brief History of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.

Hawking suffers from a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. He communicates using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device. Hawking married twice and has three children.

At the release party for the home video version of the A Brief History of Time, Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993.[306][307][308] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song ""Keep Talking"",[309][234] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons.[310] Hawking appeared in documentaries entitled The Real Stephen Hawking (2001),[296] Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002) [311] and Hawking (2013), and the documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008).[312] Hawking has also guest-starred in Futurama[72] and The Big Bang Theory.[313] Hawking allowed the use of his trademarked voice in the biographical 2014 film The Theory of Everything.[314]

Hawking has used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair,[296] National Savings,[315] British Telecom, Specsavers, Egg Banking[316] and Go Compare.[317]

Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). At that time, his nomination read:

    ""Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on ""Space-time in the Large"". The citation continues:

    ""Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.""",Science and Technology

Part fact and part fiction, the timeline is based on detailed research ‚Äì including analysis of current trends, long-term environmental changes, advances in technology such as Moore's Law, future medical breakthroughs, the evolving geopolitical landscape and much more. Where possible, references have been provided to support the predictions. FutureTimeline is an ongoing, collaborative project that is open for discussion ‚Äì we welcome ideas from scientists, futurists, inventors, writers and anyone else interested in futurology.Why robots won‚Äôt take over the earth ‚Äì or your job‚ÄúAll of the forecasts you can find about Earth 2050 could become a reality in just a couple of decades. Earth 2050 is not only a creative exercise for us. For the last 20 years, Kaspersky Lab experts have been fighting with cybercrime, and they have seen threats evolving over this time. They are therefore able to share their knowledge and expertise and ‚Äì in many cases ‚Äì encourage users to take a more thorough look at the security of future technologies,‚Äù said Andrey Lavrentyev, head of technology research department .‚ÄúAlthough inventions might be amazing ‚Äì such as like driverless cars, intelligent infrastructure and the ability to instantly share medical data between doctors across the world ‚Äì they can still trip us up. Each of them brings a whole new world of opportunity for cyber criminals to exploit.‚ÄùAt the moment Earth 2050 contains predictions for 80 cities around the globe. Users can select any of these cities and forecasts will appear at the top of the map.The portal is divided into three time categories: 2030, 2040 and 2050, with each of these containing predictions from people who are recognised experts in their fields.The forum is not limited to written predictions. Earth 2050 also contains 12 VR-enabled panoramas of cities like Barcelona and Shanghai as well as illustrations of different artefacts from the future.
 The future of connectivity and delivery Users can take a 360¬∫ look at how future cities might be operating. Will we be able to adjust the appearance of every person we see in the street?Will humans invent a dress that changes its style? Are driverless cars in smart cities the future of the taxi business? Will we see ads while we sleep? These questions are just a glimpse of what a user can find on the site.Filling in a special feedback form allows visitors to add their own ideas to the portal. These will be published once they have passed through the editorial team‚Äôs review. Users can discuss existing predictions and also contribute by sharing their own.New content from the experts, and forecasts compiled from different sources, will frequently appear on the site. ‚ÄúStill, we hope to see many more names on the portal and encourage our users and site visitors to send us their craziest ideas on what the future might look like,‚Äù Andrey Lavrentyev mentioned.Manchester is a vibrant city region and hub for the North of England. But with a population of nearly 2.8 million and a growing city economy, urban traffic congestion is becoming a major issue and challenge, especially when multiple city events take place on the same day.Cisco and its partners, Purple, Proxama, Movement Strategies, Transport for Greater Manchester and Sustainable Environment Ltd are pleased to announce that they have been awarded a grant from InnovateUK to deliver a proof of concept solution that will enable Transport for Greater Manchester to better address the challenge of providing transport services to fit demand.The CitySpire proof of concept will see the development of context-aware location-based services, built on anonymised data from multiple sources, including Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi net.
Interpretation and analysis of that data will enable CitySpire to present groups of passengers to flexible and shared demand-responsive transport company, Simply Connect.The initiative will aim to prove the value of an enhanced booking capability not currently available to existing popular ride-sharing services, such as UberPool and BlaBlaCar.

911,Z3RWpybhOWA,The Internet Revolution and Digital Future Technology Documentary 2019,"The Internet Revolution and Digital Future Technology Documentary 2018 The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s. Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France. When the Internet was invented? ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the ‚Äúnetwork of networks‚Äù that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. When did people start using the Internet? On 6 August 1991, the World Wide Web went live to the world. There was no fanfare in the global press. In fact, most people around the world didn't even know what the Internet was. Even if they did, the revolution the Web ushered in was still but a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye. When did the Internet originate? Find out here. The internet began life in 1969, when scientists working for the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now known as DARPA) connected computer networks at the University of California and the Stanford Research Institute. Which country first invented the Internet? The internet protocols (TCP/IP) happened following initiatives takes by the US Government. The world-wide-web was invented by a British guy (while working at Cern) This brought us HTTP and websites. His work was inspired by the idea of hypertext. Hypertext as a concept had been bouncing around for a while. What was the original purpose of the Internet? Many people have heard that the Internet began with some military computers in the Pentagon called Arpanet in 1969. ... Bob Taylor, the Pentagon official who was in charge of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (or Arpanet) program, insists that the purpose was not military, but scientific.

925,PzPW5msevJ0,15 Recent Science Discoveries You Wont Believe,"15 amazing recent discoveries in the world of science and here they are from bionic contact lenses to reanimating dinosaur dna!

Subscribe to Talltanic 

7.  New Human Species
Biologists all over the world were intrigued upon hearing the 2015 discovery of a new species of human, Homo Naledi, allowing for an ever clearer picture of our ancient ancestry.  The findings were unveiled deep in an underground cave in South Africa and is considered one of the greatest collection of human remains ever unearthed.  So far, it is known that this species of human grew to an average height of 5 feet and had a brain no larger than an orange.  The way the bones in the South African cave were arranged suggests that these human ancestors ritualistically buried their dead, giving scientists a glimpse into our cultural past.

6.  Bionic Lens
While still in the testing stage, the founder of Ocumetics Technology Corp may have stumbled upon a revolutionary technology that could augment the way humans perceive the world.  A new bionic contact lens will give wearers an ability to see the world with stronger than 20/20 vision.  Some subjects, who have already tried the lens themselves, claim that they not only see better than ever before but have identified a unique spectrum of colors unfamiliar to the unaided eye.  Is this perhaps the first step in the direction of a new era of superhumans? 
    
5.  Harder Than Diamond
 Scientists may have recently discovered a substance harder than diamond, Q-carbon.  What gives diamonds their excellent hardness are the chemical bonds that hold them together.  The carbon in diamonds is held together by incredibly tight chemical bonds at the microscopic level, giving diamonds their prominent hardness.  By the manipulation of carbon atoms, scientists were able to augment their chemical bonds, producing a material that is potentially 60 times harder than diamond.  While this substance is still being experimented on, it is a potential prospect for the future of cheap, efficient technologies.          

4.  First Mammals
Researchers from the University of Edinburgh have discovered an ancient species of mammals that survived the notorious extinction of the dinosaurs over 65 million years ago.  The reason this find is so significant is that it gives us a glimpse at how mammals began to rule the world previously dominated by their cold-blooded counterparts.  The mammal is thought to have been a plant-eater closely resembling a modern beaver.  Once the dinosaurs were eliminated these beaver-like creatures began to flourish, given that they were no longer victims of dinosaur predators.  Because these little guys were able to withstand the destruction that wrecked havoc on the dinosaurs, an array of mammals, including our ancestors, were finally able to leave their mark on the world. 

3.  Whale Gene Mapping
Gene mapping is starting to look less like a theoretical nicety and more like an applied science with this new aquatic discovery.  Scientists have finally discovered why Bowhead Whales are able to live to 200 years old by remapping their entire genome.  By comparing the genome of Bowhead Whales with the genome of other mammals with a less impressive lifespan, scientists were able to point out marked differences.  Bowhead longevity is due to its genes‚Äô effectiveness in repairing gene deterioration, which is the cause of cancer and other ailments known to cut human life short.  By further studying this animal‚Äôs genes, scientists may finally be able to restore our own faulty genetic system, substantially lengthening our lives. 

2.  Second Earth
 NASA has recently confirmed their discovery of a possible second Earth.  Kepler-452b orbits its sun in what scientists call the ‚ÄúGoldilocks Zone,‚Äù which is the habitable region in space, not too far or close to the sun, necessary for the possibility of life to flourish.  The new planet appears to have a rocky surface as well as liquid water, which is another key ingredient for life to subsist.  Although not much is known about if there is life beyond Earth, it makes sense to take notice of planets similar to our own.

1.  Animal Re-animation
Scientists have always been intrigued by the prospect of re-animating creatures that have been extinct for many years.  While bringing a dinosaur back to life would be kind of cool, bringing a Wooly Mammoth back to life would be just as cool, and that is just what scientists are trying to do.  Because Wooly Mammoths and Saber-Toothed Tigers have only been extinct for tens of thousands of years, unlike the millions of years dinosaurs have been extinct, intact DNA samples are much easier to find.  Scientists believe it is possible to recreate these extinct beasts by cloning them with DNA and tissue samples, which have been found, over the years, preserved in ice.",Science and Technology

935,Z62eeT0bXuk,Future Technology - New Science BBC Documentary HD,"Technology (from Greek œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, -logia[3]) is the collection of techniques, methods or processes used in the production of goods or services 
or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and 
factories, which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things.

The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and 
the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have 
lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of 
ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.

Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has 
allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various 
implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human 
productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.

Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, 
anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies 
such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development 
of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their 
knowledge to other generations.

1010,PPVY1BPYY2,Postdoc's dorm room at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology),"This video shows the accommodation (provided at the rate of KRW 200,000 per month) to postdoctoral researchers whose marital status is single. This episode shows most of the amenities and furnishings in the private room. Be sure to watch the other video too, which shows surroundings outside of the private room. ()

I made this video to show what it looks like because I was never told anything about the accommodation, other than that the university had signed me up for it without my explicit permission. I had no idea about its location, or what it looked like, or anything. This video attempts to give you an idea of what the provided accommodation looks like, including amenities and room furnishing. It should help you in your packing. Since I was told nothing, I did not know what to bring. I will explain the pro's and con's. (In fact, other than being told that the university had automatically signed up for housing, I was not given ANY detail about the accommodation until 2 days before my postdoc contract started. In fact, three days before my contract started, I had received an e-mail stating ""your accommodation hasn't been decided yet.  Tomorrow, the housing office wil let me know. So then i will give you the address."")

There was a deposit amount of KRW 300,000.

The video shows the content of the room. On the door is an electronic lock system. You can set a personal code to use to unlock the door. It is convenient because you never have to carry a key (other than the key card to get in and out of the building's main entrance). It is big enough to fit the provided furniture (bed, desk, orange chair, refrigerator, wash basin, large closet, small closet). It is not big enough to fit in anything else.

At least the room is furnished, but you will have to provide your own bed sheets and pillow.

There is not even enough room on the ground to fit in a spare mattress for an overnight visitor (and I suppose this partially explains why the building's policy is to have no overnight guests).

What is not clear from this video is that this building (Male dormitory building 19) is in close proximity to other dorm buildings, including freshmen dorms. On any night of the week, at ANY hour, it is likely that very loud, rude, and drunk college students will walk between the buildings and wake you up.

Overall, the provided accommodation is extremely bad and shameful for a first-rate university to provide as housing for its postdocs. Should you come here, at least you can use these videos to see what you will get. (The contract which you must sign, which you don't get to see before coming, stipulates that you'll live in the provided accommodation for at least 6 months.)

What's also very interesting is that the four nearby high-rise GRADUATE STUDENT APARTMENTS are much nicer than these, with private kitchens, bathrooms, and several bedrooms. I hope the university wisens up and treats us postdocs the way we deserve to be treated.",Science and Technology

1016,IsPVFvdeWQ,Food Science | Norman Potter 5th Edition-Book Review,"Food Science by Norman Potter - Book Review. 
Here's a review of one the best and famous textbooks for the students of Food Science and Food Technology. 
In this video, I have reviewed Food Science by Norman Potter - 5th edition. 
********************************************************************
Amazon Link for Food Science Book -  
********************************************************************
Amazon link for Objective Food Science by S. K. Sharma -
 
Best part about this book - It covers most of the basic concepts of food science and technology. 

There‚Äôs a famous quote from a man ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you are an expert in your field, you won‚Äôt have to run after opportunities, rather the opportunities will come running after you‚Äù.

Now if you want to be an expert in food science or food technology, you‚Äôll have to take small steps every day. And this book by Norman Potter will provide you a strong foundation to build the basic concepts of food science and technology. 

Now, food science by Norman Potter is the one of the best books for any student who‚Äôs pursuing a major/degree in food science/technology. 
The authors of this book ‚Äì N. Potter & Joseph Hotchkiss have been Professors in the Department of Food Science at the Cornell University, in New York. 
Cornell University has one of the oldest departments of food science in the world and this university ranks amongst top 20 universities all over the world. 

So, this book has a pretty solid background. 

This book is not only going to be helpful for you in the first/second year, but this book is also going to provide you some reference & some insight even in your whole graduation even in your post-graduation. 

I refer to this book even now. 

There are 25 chapters and the book is about 600 pages.  
Price ranges from 450-490 [Usually stays below 500]. 

Most of the faculties and most of the professors refer to this textbook because of its versatility and coverage of the basic concepts as well. 

And this is why I highly recommend for you to study, to read this book, to understand the concepts of this book. 
To build a strong foundation of Food Science and technology so that you can build an expertise in the food industry and in the academics of your college.

The best technology-based companies don't have a hard time finding employees to work on technical projects and investors see no shortage of entrepreneurs with good ideas for products but executives and investors both agree that they can't often find engineers and scientists who have what it takes to build the business around their new technologies. When looking to develop business and management skills, engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures, both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, Tesla, JDS Uniphase
as well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.
We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allow
you to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars and
teachers in the field of technology management who have invested in, founded, lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours, extracurricular events, even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart, ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology,  focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents,  this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application, visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.",Science and Technology

UW‚Äôs Master of Science in Technology Innovation teaches you how to design, develop and launch the connected solutions of the future. The MSTI is offered by the Global Innovation Exchange, a new partnership between the UW and Tsinghua University in China, with support from Microsoft. GIX brings students, faculty and industry professionals together to collaborate on solutions to global challenges such as sustainability and health care. Learn more at .

Video Transcript:

[Shwetak] 
What the MSTI, or the master‚Äôs of science and technology innovation degree, is all about is to really provide a broad understanding of what it means to innovate on a piece of technology. 

This includes the design aspect of it. How do you know that you're building the right thing and how you're building it right? But also prototyping. How do you know that the thing that you're trying to build is even feasible? So appreciating hardware and software development so that you know that this thing can even be built. And then pitching it, and then getting funding for it. So the entrepreneurial side of how do you launch a venture like this. 

And so the program is designed to integrate across all three of these different areas in an offering where a student can do it in one specific degree.

[Linda] 
I think increasingly, in the pace of innovation and development in the technology fields, there's a growing expectation that any one person has a more rounded skillset, that has some of each of those in their skillset. And those are the professionals and the emerging students that are in more demand.

The program is a 15-month program, so you would start in the fall, go the full four quarters and then a fifth quarter which is your launch phase.

[Shwetak] 
So the first 12 months is you'll be iterating on a number of different projects, and you learn the, just the basics through these classes and tutorials.

[Linda] 
Each quarter there's going to be a range of classes from some sort of very specific hands-on studios, something maybe as specific as a hardware-software lab or something about micro-controllers, to a design-thinking studio, which is going to be more processed based.

[Shwetak] 
In the last three months of the 15-month period is what we call the launch phase. So you really settle on a particular project that you want to take it to the next level.

It could be that you're working on a project that's sponsored by a corporation. It can be something where the student comes in and has their own idea, recruits students within the cohort to help them with their project that might get them to a point where they start to maybe spin out a company at the end of the program.

[Linda] 
UW has a fantastic reputation for being the most innovative public university, which is wonderful. There's such a great embracing and support structure here at the University, and in Seattle more broadly, for innovation, for startups.

[Shwetak] 
One of the things that's interesting about this program is not just the top faculty engaging with the students, but it's also the mentors and the, and the technologists and the thought leaders in the Pacific Northwest. This includes members of the venture capital community. It includes engineers and thought leaders at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing.

[Linda] 
So there's a really, a coalescing of that energy, those services, that perspective, that experience in the community here from industry, that GIX will be able to tap into.

[Shwetak] 
So the MSTI is housed within the Global Innovation Exchange.

[Linda] 
GIX, Global Innovation Exchange, is a unique partnership between University of Washington, Tsinghua University and industry partners, most notably Microsoft. It encompasses a new type of interdisciplinary degree program that is much more team- and project-based, hands-on, to develop a closer partnership between industry partners and the educational experience and to really bring together kind of three different domains: technical innovation, an entrepreneurship lens and understanding of the business landscape.

[Shwetak] 
And so we're looking at how do we engage the larger community? Not just the local community, but the global community, to create these really innovative graduate programs that allow students to solve these real-world problems and do it in such a way that's global in spirit.

[Linda] 
So I'm really excited also about the facility that is being developed that will have maker space, and team spaces, studio facilities, you know, be state-of-the-art in terms of technology. It's really going to be a fantastic place for industry, faculty and students to come and work and engage and collaborate.

[Shwetak] 
This program is really designed to teach people how to become innovators.",Science and Technology

In this excellent new documentary Kingdoms of Sumeria ‚ÄòThe Legacy of Sumerian Scientists‚Äô we take on some of the biggest enigmas of the Sumerians, in our journey so far. Many will know of certain Sumerian and Babylonian scientific curiosities and their inventions, but what is the origins of these scientific endeavours? 

Astonishing evidence now shows Sumerian science was high, it was preserved in later cultures, and it was unprecedented. Kingdoms of Sumeria were vast domains all connected through a trade network, which in this episode is shown through the Sumerian Science Endeavours. The most insightful of all is the roots in Armenia, which many scholars shy away from.

Technology (from Greek œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, -logia[1]) is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.

The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.

Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.

Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.",Science and Technology

1047,lATa1bdU3E,President Obama Stresses Importance of Science and Technology to the Nation's Future,"On April 29, 2013 -  President Barack Obama reiterated his strong support for science and technology in this speech to members of the National Academy of Sciences at its 150th annual meeting. Science, technology, engineering, and medicine are critical to the nation's prosperity, Obama said, noting that investments made today are bound to pay off for many years to come. 

The president warned that recent mandatory cuts in federal spending could slow these critical advances in research.  ""With the pace of technological innovation today, we can't afford to stand still for a year or two years or three years,"" Obama said. ""We've got to seize every opportunity we have to stay ahead, and we can't let other countries win the race for ideas and technology of the future."" 

Just as science and technology have advanced the nation in the past, he noted, they will be critical in addressing today's challenges. ""We will continue to pursue advances in science, engineering, infrastructure, education, and environmental protection, and especially science-based innovations to help us minimize and adapt to global threats like climate change,"" Obama said.

President Obama made an impassioned plea to ensure that the nation's young people continue to maintain their spirit of discovery and receive strong educations in STEM.  ""We don't want our kids just to be consumers of the amazing things that science generates,"" Obama said. ""We want them to be producers as well.  We've got to make sure we're supporting that next generation of dreamers and risk takers."" 

Since Abraham Lincoln signed the congressional charter founding the National Academy of Sciences 150 years ago, the Academy has played a critical role in advancing science and shaping public policy. ""[Lincoln] recognized that finding a way to harness the highest caliber scientific advice for the government would serve a whole range of long-term goals for the nation,"" Obama said, noting that his administration turns to the Academy for advice on many issues.

""Like President Lincoln 150 years ago, President Obama clearly understands the importance of S&T to the future prosperity and security of our nation,"" said NAS President Ralph J. Cicerone in introductory remarks. ""We're pleased that President Obama and the administration continue to turn to the National Academy of Sciences for help, analysis, and advice on many issues facing the nation and the world today.""

President Obama is the only president to address the National Academy of Sciences' annual gatherings of members twice; he also spoke at the 2009 NAS annual meeting. Other presidents who have addressed the NAS include George H.W. Bush in 1990, John F. Kennedy, who spoke at the NAS Centennial Convocation in 1963 and at the NAS annual meeting in 1961, Jimmy Carter in 1979, and Calvin Coolidge in 1924.

The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership, and -- with the National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council -- provides science, technology, and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.",Science and Technology

1059,Qd_5as_cMY,"Humans, Gods and Technology - VPRO documentary - 2017","What will our world look like 25 years from now? Watch this lecture about the meaning of life shaped by technology in a near future.
Nobody knows how our world will look like in 25 years. Perhaps our work is taken over by autonomous robots and we become the slaves of the technology we have created ourselves. The big questions about the future of man and his relation to technology are presented to two important thinkers of the moment: Kevin Kelly and Yuval Noah Harari.
Kevin Kelly is a writer of influential works such as What Technology Wants and The Inevitable. Kelly sketches the inevitability of technology and even sees technology as an autonomous evolutionary system. Artificial intelligence becomes commonplace for everyone and will help us analyze difficult issues and challenge them to reflect on who we are. Kelly is convinced that we are already seen as Gods by technology and that robots will also believe in their own Gods.
Yuval Noah Harari is a writer of books about the history of Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus. Harari sketches the history of tomorrow and analyzes the way in which we create our own illusions; illusory institutions such as religion, states and money. We believe in gods because we want to be them ourselves. Harari sees a society with inequalities where some people can upgrade themselves to gods and others will remain vulnerable and mortal.

Top 5 technologies to learn in 2018.

Technologies are :
IoT (Internet of Things)
Cloud Computing
Blockchain
Artificial Intelligence
Big Data 

IoT : The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data.
The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure.

Cloud Computing: Cloud computing enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet.
Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility.
Third-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.
Cloud providers typically use a ""pay-as-you-go"" model.

Blockchain: A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography which is resistant to modification of the data.
Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data.
Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system 
The first blockchain was conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and implemented in 2009 as a core component of bitcoin where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions.

Artificial intelligence: AI is intelligence displayed by machines.
In computer science, AI research is defined as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.
Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem-solving

Big Data: Big data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data processing application software is inadequate to deal with them.
Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating and information privacy.
There are three dimensions to big data known as Volume, Variety and Velocity.

The explosion of Supernova
According to the leading scientists, two stars will collide in the constellation cygnus. As a result, a supernova will occur, and a huge amount of energy will be ejected into space. It will be brighter that the light from a majority of stars in the galaxy. The consequences will be visible to the naked eye from the earth's surface. It will take place in 2022.

1100,xqRiU7ycUY,Singularities | Black Holes - Space Documentary,"If you read any science fiction or futurism, you've probably heard people using the term ""singularity"" to describe the world of tomorrow. But what exactly does it mean, and where does the idea come from? We answer in today's backgrounder.

What is the singularity?

The term singularity describes the moment when a civilization changes so much that its rules and technologies are incomprehensible to previous generations. Think of it as a point-of-no-return in history.

Most thinkers believe the singularity will be jump-started by extremely rapid technological and scientific changes. These changes will be so fast, and so profound, that every aspect of our society will be transformed, from our bodies and families to our governments and economies.

A good way to understand the singularity is to imagine explaining the internet to somebody living in the year 1200. Your frames of reference would be so different that it would be almost impossible to convey how the internet works, let alone what it means to our society. You are on the other side of what seems like a singularity to our person from the Middle Ages. But from the perspective of a future singularity, we are the medieval ones. Advances in science and technology mean that singularities might happen over periods much shorter than 800 years. And nobody knows for sure what the hell they'll bring.

Talking about the singularity is a paradox, because it is an attempt to imagine something that is by definition unimaginable to people in the present day. But that hasn't stopped hundreds of science fiction writers and futurists from doing it.

Where does the term ""singularity"" come from?

Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge popularized the idea of the singularity in his 1993 essay ""Technological Singularity."" There he described the singularity this way:

It is a point where our old models must be discarded and a new reality rules. As we move closer to this point, it will loom vaster and vaster over human affairs till the notion becomes a commonplace. Yet when it finally happens it may still be a great surprise and a greater unknown.
Specifically, Vinge pinned the Singularity to the emergence of artificial intelligence. ""We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth,"" he wrote. ""The precise cause of this change is the imminent creation by technology of entities with greater than human intelligence.""

Author Ken MacLeod has a character describe the singularity as ""the Rapture for nerds"" in his novel The Cassini Division, and the turn of phrase stuck, becoming a popular way to describe the singularity. (Note: MacLeod didn't actually coin this phrase - he says he got the phrase from a satirical essay in an early-1990s issue of Extropy.) Catherynne Valente argued recently for an expansion of the term to include what she calls ""personal singularities,"" moments where a person is altered so much that she becomes unrecognizable to her former self. This definition could include posthuman experiences.
Humans could escape from black holes, rather than getting stuck in them, according to a new theory proposed by Stephen Hawking.

Shortcuts in engineering design can lead to engineering disasters. Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.[1] These demands include buildings, aircraft, vessels, and computer software. In order to meet society‚Äôs demands, the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively. To accomplish this, managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally, these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.

Many kind of future technology out there are in their research phases. Some of these futurist visions are soon becoming reality. Sooner than later, all this futurist inventions will be in your home for you to use. Technology is a fast evolving field and what may appear as futurist today, may be history tomorrow. Hence, keeping up with technological advancements will give you a good idea of what you can expect for the future.

Some people would like future technology to be in the form of free energy such as solar or electro-magnetic. This is being studied and will soon become a reality. There is even talk in some circles of making transporters so that people can travel faster from one place to another literally at the speed of light. This would do away with vehicles as well as traffic jams.

If you have seen Star Trek, you would have seen the wonderful future technology that they have such as the food replicator. Wouldn't it be just perfect if you could imagine the food and it would appear? Think about all the possibilities it would have, especially to solve world hunger. In addition, if one could have something that is a universal communicator, which would make traveling that much easier. You would not have to struggle to understand the locals.

Some of the other future technology that could be just around the corner is flying cars. It would be great because you won't have to deal with traffic jams as you can just fly over them. But then again, what would happen if there were too many of them in the sky? It just might cause more accidents than anything else might. On the other hand, you could get to where you want to go very fast with no hassle.

Some of the most popular future technology is in the form of robots. Now they are building robots for everything. Right from doing the vacuuming of your house to making your food for you they can work unsupervised. There are robots that are programmed to be butlers, who will take care of your day-to-day activities. There are robots that are trained to be companions for the elderly. This is very important because the elderly need to have someone around. They also serve as nurses and help the elderly in their day-to-day activities as well.

So one can expect the future to be an interesting combination of all these inventions that are being developed today to simplify our lives.

A futurist is more like an artist, who can picture what the future is going to look like but the only difference is that a futurist will predict the future based on statistics and trends and not leave everything to imagination. I call them 'Scientific artists'.

LATEST TECH

Data-as-a-Service was a huge theme for the year, one in which we saw strong interest from industries ranging from health wearables and auto manufacturers, to industrial solution providers. The conversation around how to take advantage of data you already own, and develop products that will generate increasing volumes of valuable data, markedly gained in intensity over the last year. This also closely tied into our theme of Cognitive is the New Smart, with all of this data serving as the foundation for AI capabilities.

LATEST TECH

One trend in which our outlier prediction prevailed over traditional expectations was about the trend of increasing insularity, nationalism and protectionism.  it looked as though countries around the world were poised to turn inward and retreat from the global stage. While that did happen in isolated cases, for the most part voters (just about) rejected this continued sentiment in major elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands.

LATEST TECH

As we look to , we see several common themes emerging: the rapidly growing and transformational nature of technology continues to dominate the conversation, but we can expect it to be paralleled by an increasingly passionate debate about the extent and degree of government and regulatory influence aimed at mitigating the growing power of technology. This will gain momentum as leading tech companies race toward a trillion dollar valuation, and scrutiny of and protection against misinformation and hacking increases. Further in the technology space, we can also expect to see the emergence of themes that were regarded as the preserve of science fiction, such as the testing of flying cars (truly, back to the future!) and the emergence of quantum supremacy. Less tech-focused themes include the rise of a new generation of political leaders and the growing adoption of behavioural science by enterprises, with a focus on optimising both employee productivity and consumer purchase patterns.

The Trillion-Dollar Sprint

is likely to be the year that a leading Fortune 500 company (think tech titans Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon, with petroleum giant Saudi Aramco crashing the tech party) surpasses the trillion dollar valuation mark. 
The Innovation Tug-of-War

LATEST TECH

Rising concerns regarding technology companies‚Äô increasing power is driving pushback from government organizations, and we expect this trend to gain momentum in  Greater government and regulatory oversight is likely to protect consumers and curb corporate overreach, but may also stunt innovation. Underscoring this trend will be the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect in mid- as well as adjusted net neutrality rules in the US.

The Quantum Leap

Long the domain of science fiction and theory, quantum computing looks poised to outperform traditional supercomputers and achieve supremacy in . Competitors in the space are aggressively racing to increase their qubit computing power, while minimizing the potential for errors. Experimentation of quantum computing in conjunction with encryption, AI, materials, and qubit generation will be key areas of focus in. Be ready to hear ‚ÄúQuantum‚Äù as the next buzz word.

The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.
Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy‚Äôs two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.
Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger‚Äîsort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company‚Äôs new spacesuit would ride in the driver‚Äôs seat of the electric sports car ,nicknamed Starman.

Akarsh is a grade 11 student in his first year at BIS. He has lived in Chennai, India for 5 years and Ann Arbor, Michigan for 10. His speech is about the acceptance of technology in our daily lives and the neccessity of involving all ages in this technology boom. His interest in this topic came from the apparent lack of integration of technology into society when he lived in India.

All of these tricks take advantage of static electricity. In general, the lower the humidity, the better these tricks will work. The most impressive one to me is the floating bag trick. Depending on the conditions, you can float an entire grocery sack. 

1. Hover Plate: (You need Styrofoam Plates and a cloth) Styrofoam plates are great for static electricity tricks. When you give them a charge and hold one above the other, you can feel an incredible amount of resistance.

2. Can Can Go (You need a coke can, PVC pipe and a cloth) This is a classic but still fun. Try standing the can up and then tip it over with static, or try pulling 2 cans at the same time.

3. Stick Around (You need a small wooden stick, glass jar, thread, tape, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is fun because half of the time the wooden stick will come toward the pvc pipe, and other times it will move away from the pipe. When it moves away, it will stick the the side of the jar and remain there for a period of time. It also fun to use as large a jar as possible to increase the dramatic effect of the pipe moving the stick from such a large distance.

4. Bubble Trouble (You need bubble solution, plexi-glass, PVC pipe, straw and a cloth. This is a fun trick because the bubbles change their shape and move when the pvc pipe is near. It's also fun to create bubbles inside of bubbles to watch the effect of the static electricity. And also create multiple bubbles on the sheet and watch them all travel toward the pipe.

5. Dancing Balls (You need styrofoam balls, aluminum foil, plexi-glass, cloth, and an area to keep the balls from escaping. This trick is really impressive but can be a bit difficult to recreate. When the plexi-glass plate is charged and placed over the balls, they all jump up and stick to the bottom of the glass. For a few moments they travel around sporadically until they finally settle. But when you put your finger near the glass, they all start jumping around. It's also fun to use these balls with styrofoam plates / cups. If you place the ball on a charged plate, it will shoot off of the plate, or stick to it, even if the plate is held sideways or upside down.

6. Water Bender (You need a cup that you can poke a hole in,  water, PVC pipe and a cloth. This is  a classic but still fun. 

7. Balloon Fight (You need balloons, thread, PVC pipe and cloth. When the conditions are just right, the balloon can almost levitate about the pipe. But most of the time you can have fun pushing the balloons around with the charged pipe.

8. Electroscope (You need, steel wire, jar, straw, aluminum foil, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is really impressive to see in person. A really cool effect to try, which you can see in this video, is to rub the cloth on the pvc pipe from several feet away from the jar. When you run the pipe, you can see the aluminum foil pieces in the jar, moving. I was able to stand as far as 5 feet away and still see the effect.

9. Wingardium Leviosa (You need very light weight / thin plastic bags, cloth, PVC pipe) This is my favorite trick. Again, with the correct conditions, you can get the plastic pieces  to float over foot above the pipe. Produce bags from the grocery store work great. You can float an entire produce bag in the right conditions.

1153,d5DpQ6PghCQ,Mind Blowing Facts About Nanotechnology,"Nanotechnology : Interesting Facts About Nanotechnology (Telugu) By Rajak Shaik's

Nanotechnology is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Through 2012, the USA has invested $3.7 billion using its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the European Union has invested $1.2 billion, and Japan has invested $750 million.

Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage,[4][5] microfabrication, molecular engineering, etc.The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly,[8] from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.

Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

To download the PDF and solve MCQs again for effective revision, visit: https://www.civilstap.com

History, polity, economy, geography, environment, science and tech - these are the sections (along with associated current affairs) that form the core of GS syllabus as far as UPSC is concerned.
Aspirants generally visualize these sections differently when it comes to prelims and mains - however the same is not the case. It is essential that the topics are covered in a holistic manner so that any question, be it prelims or mains can be handled effectively.
We shall be providing 1 lecture as part of this series daily covering one section of GS followed by 5 MCQs.
The interesting thing here is that the same day we shall also be discussing 1 mains question from the same topic (under the Prayaas series) so as to forge that organic linkage between prelims and mains that is very much required for each aspirant.
A solid foundation builds a base for everything to be added upon it. Sthaapna series follows the same philosophy making your GS foundation interactive with MCQs and their PDFs enabling you to cover all GS concepts in a fun and quick way. 
You can have a look at all Sthaapna videos in an organized manner on our website - www.civilstap.com

Our motto - 
Read less, revise more
Minimum effort, maximum gain
How do we plan to stick by our motto?
1) By deeply analyzing all previous year papers - both prelims and mains
2) By identifying all important topics and sub topics
3) By covering the above identified topics - both static and dynamic as part of our lectures on youtube
4) By keeping the length of material as well as videos short yet complete - for easy and effective revision

1193,xtvcj-dFiT,Stupidest Myth About Food Technology In India [BUSTED!!!],"In this lecture, I've Busted the Stupidest myth about Food Technology In India.
All of us know that both the fields (Foodtech and HM) are related to food. Although they can seem similar but these two branches are very different. 
This is my responsibility as a food technologist to spread awareness about food technology. And today I‚Äôm going to share with you some major differences between food technology and hotel management and then I‚Äôll leave it up to you whether you compare these two branches or not. 

Difference #1. Food Technology is the application of Food Science that deals with the production process of food. 

Whereas on the other hand, Hotel management includes different functions of a hotel like Food & Beverage Management, Tourism Management, Finance, HR etc.

Difference #2. The primary purpose of a food technologist is to ‚ÄòExtend the shelf life‚Äô of a product and make it safe for consumption of humans.

Whereas on the other hand, in hotel management the primary purpose of a chef is to simply ‚ÄòSatisfy/Please the Customers‚Äô.  

Difference #3. In food technology, a food is produced only after a lot of scientific experimentation and research is done on a particular product. And that experimentation is usually done on a prototype/sample. 

Whereas in the case of hotel management, a product is produced not based on scientific experimentations, but rather according to the choice of the chef/consumer demand. 

Difference #4 Please pay close attention over here cos this difference is the key difference between food technology & hotel management. 

In Food technology there are a lot of standards that have to be followed if a food technologist wants to produce a product. What does that mean? 

Simply means that there are a lot of standards set up by some kind of regulatory authority, so that the food produced is safe to consume for humans. These standards could be something like - e.g. if a food technologist is going to produce French Fries in a food factory, he/she must strictly stick to some standards like frying at 1900C. Or amount of preservatives added must be fixed or the strains of a particular bacteria present must be controlled. 

Now, these are just 3 simple examples of standards. There are actually a lot of standards present right now. There are probably more than 1000 standards present right now and these standards are regulated by an authority. That authority in India is FSSAI (Food Safety & Standards Authority of India). If you don‚Äôt believe me about such a huge list of standards you can visit www.fssai.gov.in and see for yourself the huge list, they have for standards and regulations for different food commodities. 
On the other hand, in hotel management, there are also standards and procedures for the operations over there. But if you compare the standards of hotel management in a kitchen, with the standards of a food factory, the number of standards that are applied in a Food Factory are much higher as compared to the standards applied in the kitchen of a hotel industry. 
Also, the level of quality and strictness of standards also depend upon the star ranking of a hotel. 
What I mean by that is there are 5 star, 4 star, 3 star hotels. You get my point. 5-star hotels provide best quality food, the best quality of everything cos they have some strict standards, rules and regulations. The strictness of these rules start degrading by one level if you drop down from 5 star to 4 star, 4 star to 3 star and so on. 
But in the case of food factory, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the food industry is small or the food industry is big, both of these(food) industries or all the food industries have to follow a specific set of standards to maintain the quality.
And that is one major difference between food technology & hotel management. 
One more thing I‚Äôd like to add here that even if you don‚Äôt consider these differences, even if you don‚Äôt want to consider these differences, let me ask you one question. How come some celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Sanjeev Kapoor are called ‚ÄòChefs‚Äô and not ‚ÄòFood Technologists‚Äô?

1196,TY6N_iJTaIM,Falcon Heavy- Birth of a New Era in Space Exploration,"Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 20 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight, carrying Elon Musk‚Äôs red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. 
The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.
Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy‚Äôs two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.
Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger‚Äîsort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company‚Äôs new spacesuit would ride in the driver‚Äôs seat of the electric sports car. Nicknamed Starman

1200,P-ABeWFx5hI,10 WAYS THE INTERNET HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES FOREVER,"How has the Internet impacted our lives? Gadgets and technology play a part in our lives, but it literally is just a part. Don‚Äôt ever succumb to panic ‚Äî real life is definitely still out there despite the huge affect that the Internet has to modern life. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs funny to think about the hundreds of little ways it has changed our behavior. Here are ten of the ones we‚Äôve noticed. How many do you recognize?

TIMESTAMPS: 
Kids and gadgets 
The age of the selfie 
Social media benefits 
Why you should take your phone to the bathroom 
Google or mother? 
The Internet and flirting 
The power of likes 
Everything‚Äôs for TV shows fans 
Are modern pirates dangerous? 
What are you thinking about at 3 a.m.? 

  

SUMMARY:
- These days, it‚Äôs almost impossible to make kids play outside the house. Well, sometimes they do go outside, but only if you allow them to take their gadgets with them.
- Before the Internet-era, we used to take a real camera with us on our trips. Moving on to these days: ‚ÄòDid you pack the selfie stick? ‚Äì Sure! And I‚Äôm using it right right now! Smile!‚Äô
- Years ago, you had to call a newspaper to place your ad to sell a car. Welcome to today: you just click-click-click on Facebook ‚Äì and done! Here you go: ‚ÄòHey guys, I‚Äôm selling my car, please share, repost!‚Äô
- A few clicks on your phone ‚Äì and a toilet paper is delivered to you by one of your family members. Just don‚Äôt forget to take your phone to the bathroom.
- These days, you hardly meet people in person anymore ‚Äì instead, you get personal messages. Something like ‚ÄòHey, sweetie, what‚Äôs the difference between you and a shining star?‚Äô.
- Nowadays, you can download three seasons of your favorite show altogether and binge on them during the weekend.
- These days, pirates look more like this. Their treasure is free media all over the Internet ‚Äì and they don‚Äôt even have to leave their houses to get it.
- Nowadays, it‚Äôs 3 a.m., you are supposed to be up at 6 a.m., but you suddenly need to know what celery dreams about.

1221,RpSbgczuqd,Falcon Heavy Montage [Extended version]- A Momentous Technological Feat,"Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 22 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight, carrying Elon Musk‚Äôs red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor. Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy‚Äôs two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads. Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger‚Äîsort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company‚Äôs new spacesuit would ride in the driver‚Äôs seat of the electric sports car ,nicknamed Starman.

One of the most disturbing things going on in society now is the fact that us common folk have to rely on large government ran agency‚Äôs to transport so much information to us. I mean think about it, if we really needed to know the biggest secrets circling the world, where would we turn? Well, hopefully your first stop would be Top 5 Supreme! Today we have a very special episode for you, called NASA Wants This Video Banned From the Internet! Before we get started with today‚Äôs video don‚Äôt forget to click the bell to get notified every single day with the best Top‚Äôs you‚Äôll ever see. Also, don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to this channel. So let‚Äôs get rolling!

#5 7 Earth Sized Planets

Even though the year is 2018 and humans have been searching the skies for hundreds of years, a brand new, record breaking discovery was just made. Astronomers have recently found 7 new earth sized planets that are surprisingly similar to earth. The planets surround a particular star that‚Äôs far smaller than our sun, but the star caught there attention because it seems that the star is growing dimmer everyday. Or, it could just be that it‚Äôs planets are rotating in between the star and our earth based telescopes, causing the brightness to go down. Nontheless, it is an amazing discovery that astronomers are super excited about. This also brings the total number of discovered planets to a staggering 3,449. You really gonna tell me that there isn‚Äôt life on ANY of them?

#4 New Bacterial Life

Recently scientists discovered a brand new form of bacterial life in 2 different clean rooms that are nowhere near each other. One was in Florida and the other was in South America. The important thing about these recent findings is that if and when we discovery life in space, wherever that may be, we would have to examine it against known earthy microbes, just to rule out the possibility that it isn‚Äôt something that we just carried out there from here. We‚Äôll definitely keep you updated as to what scientists say as a result of this recent discovery.

#3 Habitable Zone

Recently NASA‚Äôs Kepler Mission discovered it‚Äôs first earth sized planet located in what scientists call ‚Äòthe habitable zone‚Äô. This is huge news for many reasons, but primarily because it could be the first real discovery that could lead to life in outer space finally being discovered. While the planet is about 10% larger than earth, it does fit into the habitable zone for the star that it orbits. There is one major difference from the earth, however. The star that this planet orbits is far less powerful than our sun, in fact, the most energy it receives from its star is only about the strength we get from our soon about an hour before it sets. The planet, named Kepler 186f, is about 500 light years away from Earth, so it may be a little while still before we have that extraterrestrial life proof that we‚Äôre all so desperately searching for.

#2 NASA‚Äôs Big Discovery

So apparently sometimes NASA does indeed make some big announcements, and about a month ago it did just that. The discovery was that NASA had finally confirmed that Mars does indeed possess the quote ‚Äòbuilding blocks of life‚Äô. That‚Äôs right, NASA‚Äôs Curiosity Mars rover was launched back in 2012, and it wasn‚Äôt until 2018 that they made the announcement that the red planet contains organic molecules. This suggests that there either was or still if competent life on Mars. That‚Äôs right folks, we could be on the brink of one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time!

#1 Newborn Planet

Check out this picture, which is what scientists in Germany are saying is the first image of a newborn baby planet! They‚Äôre saying this planet is about 370 lightyears away from the earth, soooo you may not want to Uber there. . . that would get expensive. But it is interesting and cool to see what planets look like when they‚Äôre brand new! Obviously it takes a pretty large telescope to see that far, and I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm looking forward to what else that thing can find in outer space! And that is today‚Äôs list! Thanks for watching today's video. If you like this list, leave a thumbs up and share with all of your friends!

1231,rNV-yKJWQC8,SpaceX- Rewind 2018: A Year To Remember,"SpaceX Rewind 2018:-
Building off its earlier momentum‚Äî8 launches in 2016 and 18 in 2017, SpaceX pulled off 21 launches in 2018, a staggering achievement for the 16-year-old company. 
SpaceX‚Äôs reusable rocket technology moved out of the proof-of-concept stage to become the backbone of a growing fleet of flight-proven rockets. Although the company landed its first rocket in 2015, it took until 2017 for SpaceX to reuse its first booster. This year landings became almost routine, and engineers bid farewell to the moderately reusable Falcons of yesterday, ushering in an era of more capable Falcons, dubbed the Block 5.
Another long-standing goal was to debut its heavy-lift rocket, the Falcon Heavy. First estimated to fly back in 2013, the Falcon Heavy took its inaugural flight on Feb. 6th. After sending a cherry red Tesla roadster (complete with Starman pilot) on a journey past Mars, the three cores of the Falcon Heavy‚Äîeach essentially its own Falcon 9 rocket‚Äîreturned to Earth. Two of the boosters touched down in perfect synchronization on LZ-1 and LZ-2, SpaceX‚Äôs designated landing zones at Cape Canaveral. The Heavy‚Äôs center booster, however, missed its targeted landing spot on a waiting drone ship, and plopped into the Atlantic Ocean.
Musk announced that Yusaku Maezawa was the mysterious billionaire who had reserved both seats the first paying customer on SpaceX‚Äôs next-generation rocket‚Äîthe BFR. Billed from the start as an interplanetary transport vehicle, BFR (which is composed of two parts, a rocket and a spaceship capable of carrying hundreds of people into space)

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

BEL√âM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It‚Äôs all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cacha√ßa - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cacha√ßa, Brazil‚Äôs sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it‚Äôs serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There‚Äôs nothing like Amazon fruits and here‚Äôs the juices we tried: Cupua√ßu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here‚Äôs where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Bel√©m!

Tacac√° Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacac√°, I still can‚Äôt believe how good it is, and how it‚Äôs not loved all over the world! We also had Vatap√°. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Ros√°rio Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Ros√°rio Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Bel√©m, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

1247,Im2gVWc2-hU,TURKISH STREET FOOD : You've NEVER Seen this Before!!! KEBAB HEAVEN + Street Food in Izmir Turkey,"Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar Street Food tour in IZMIR, TURKEY

Welcome to the first episode of our Turkey street food series. historical KEMERALTI BAZAAR (Tarihi Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈üƒ±sƒ±)!

We start our street food tour at a famous ‚Äúb√∂rek√ßisi‚Äù for some savoury b√∂rek pastries. We ordered our b√∂rek with pastirma and cheese. It was very delicious and fun to watch the chef prepare the dish! (17 TRY / 2.92 USD)

Continuing through the ancient 7th century market, we find an extremely unique shop serving up an Izmir speciality Tur≈°u Suyu, which is pickle juice! Made up of simple ingredients to be sour, spicy and extremely refreshing. Pickle juice is best enjoyed in Izmir in the summer heat! (3 TRY / 0.52 USD)

For lunch, we try manisa kebap, hailing from the city of Manisa which is right outside of Izmir. The dish consists of kebab chunks, served on top of flatbread with a side of tomato sauce and yogurt. It is also covered in rich butter. So mouthwatering and very CHEAP! (32 TRY / 5.50 USD with unlimited tea)

Just outside of the market is the Izmir Clock Tower. It is considered the symbol of Izmir and shouldn‚Äôt be missed while you‚Äôre in the city. It is a great place to take in the views of the sea. 

We were craving something sweet and went back into the market for shambli, a semolina cake soaked in syrup, mixed with walnuts, filled with cream, and some are covered in crushed pistachio. This will give you a sugar HIGH! (regular 5 TRY / 0.86 USD + pistachio 6 TRY / 1.03 USD)

To wash it all down, Turkish coffee is like no other coffee in the world and many shops have their own unique way of making it. Turkish coffee is always unfiltered so expect it to be strong and full of silt. (7 TRY / 1.20 USD)

We made a quick stop for ‚Äúmacun‚Äù which is an Ottoman candy. It is made in the most traditional way and these vendors do not have 1 location.  (4 TRY / 0.69 USD)

For our final stop of the day, we had to eat some seafood because Izmir is quite famous for it‚Äôs fresh fish! We chose a midye dolma (translation: STUFFED MUSSELS) restaurant. These mussels are stuffed with spiced rice and locals squeeze lemon directly onto each and every mussel.These were the FRESHEST mussels we‚Äôve tried in all of Turkey! (14 TRY / 2.41 USD for half kilo)

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They‚Äôre so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi‚Äôs scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn‚Äôt have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn‚Äôt small, but at the same time, it wasn‚Äôt huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I‚Äôd never had it before. It‚Äôs a big, crunchy kachori that‚Äôs stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It‚Äôs an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn‚Äôt contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn‚Äôt wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it‚Äôs a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

Mombasa is a beautiful city located in Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. It‚Äôs a melting pot of a city, full of culture and delicious food. In this video, I met up with Farhana and Samil, both from Mombasa, and both love to eat.

Lighthouse - First place we headed on this Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa is along the coast called Mama Ngina drive, or Lighthouse. You‚Äôll find an abundance of small snacks along the road with a view over the cliffs of the Indian ocean. Probably my favorite street food was the fried cassava chips, which are fried fresh, put into bags, then seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime juice.

Here are the main street food snacks we had:
Coconut, heart of palm, cassava - 340 KES ($3.33) total
Cassava chips
Roasted and fried cassava
Coconuts
Sweet potato, corn, many things

Next we headed into the heart of Mombasa to eat from a roadside shop selling a mixture of bhajias, fried potatoes, and fried chilies. This is legendary street food in Mombasa! When you order she puts all the fried things onto a plate and douses them in coconut chutney and hot sauce. The combination is delicious, and  my favorite item was the fried chilies.
Bhajia plate combo - 90 KES ($0.88)

Azad Ice Cream - We then had sugarcane juice, a Mombasa Kenyan favorite. They added sugarcane, plus ginger and lime.

Damascus Shawarma - 200 KES ($1.96) - One of the popular food trucks in Mombasa is Damascus shawarma. It was pretty good.

Abbasi Darbar - To finish off this Kenyan food tour of Mombasa, we ended with a  mega meat feast at Abbasi Darbar, a great place to fulfill all your meat needs. We ordered most of what they offer on the menu. Everything was delicious,  but I think the winner for me was the spring chicken tikka.
Total price - 1,900 KES ($18.64)

Again, thank you for Farhana for taking me on this amazing Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa, Kenya. Be sure to check out her channel here:

1257,rOAbYFdNQE,"The Ultimate DUBAI FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Emirati Cuisine in Dubai, UAE!","Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!
Peyman‚Äôs Channel‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...
Subscribe for 2 new videos per week‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) and my friends Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing you in FULL ON for a huge IFTAR Pakistani Street food in Karachi tour for RAMZAN also known as Ramadan!!  We're trying EXTREME Chicken Chargha cooked right on the street using local Pakistani recipes and spices and we are also going exploring down burns road in Karachi for lots more delicious street food!

‚ñ∫Huge thanks to Alizeh too: 

In this IFTAR Street Food tour of Karachi, Pakistan,We're going street food rangin' for tons of famous Pakistani Street Food in Karachi, mostly all the BEST and most famous Iftar Street food in Karachi, like samosas, gulab jamon, jalebi, extreme street chicken, and also some insanely delicious Pulao!! At first, I thought it was biryani, but it's actually Pulao!! It was full of chickpeas!

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment! 

Then, we're meeting up with my friends Shehroze and Alizeh to break the fast for the Iftar for Ramzan (Ramadan). We found a local restaurant and brought all the food in and purchased some extra street food and started eating!

The next day, Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing us to a very local style place to break the fast with all the locals, right under a bridge! There were HUGE pots of biryani and pulao and everyone was waiting patiently for the food. We helped serve the biryani and pulao and then had a taste for ourselves! It was one of the BEST pulao rice I've ever tasted!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

Even though the city of Hyderabad is more famous for its legendary quintessential non vegetarian wonders that are evidently more conspicuous in its culinary landscape, there is absolutely no dearth of delectable native or popular vegetarian delights in the city. So in this fun filled gastronomic sojourn we braced ourselves to gorge on some delicious vegetarian street side dishes that are widely popular among  the locals. Our host, Sankalp Vishnu, a renowned food expert in the city, took us around the vibrant locality across P G Road, Sindhi colony, Secunderabad that is well known for a wide range of regional vegetarian street food offerings. Let‚Äôs get started.

Our first stop was Top and Tasty, where we tried the Indo chinese style Manchuria pav bhaji. This innovative take on the regular pav bhaji was indeed very delicious. The garlic,red chilli punch as imbibed from the manchurian style of cooking made the dish surprisingly indulgent. 

The second stop was Shivaling Chaat corner where we tried a delicious serving of Hyderabadi style matar(yellow pea) chaat. This savoury and tangy playful dish was topped with sweetened curd, sev and sweet chutney. Unlike its North Indian counterparts, this chaat was served hot. Though that didn't diminish the fun.

The third joint that we stopped by was the Chachaji food cart where we got to taste a delicious Dabeli, a popular Gujarati snack. The perfectly balanced sweet and savoury flavour of the Dabeli was beautifully complemented by the super tasty peanut chutney. It‚Äôs a must try snack if you love the sweet notes in your dish.

The fourth place where we halted was a dosa kiosk named Dosa Verito,right outside the Mayur Pan shop. It boasts of 151 varieties of dosas. After much deliberation we settled for the macaroni pasta dosa and blueberry ice cream dosa. The former one was super cheesy and irresistible while the latter one was a truly luscious fusion treat. 

Our fifth stop was Bombay chaat house where we tried the Hyderabadi version of the Mumbai special Vada Pav. The dry garlic chutney and the unusual garnish of chopped onions enhanced its taste. 

From there we went on to our sixth stop, the Famous and Live Soda where we tried their best selling item the digest soda that is essentially soda mixed with a concentrate prepared with sugar and digestive spices like cumin ,rock salt etc. It was super refreshing and appeasing. 

This delectable veg street food journey concluded with a Paan treat from the popular paan shop in the area the Dimmy‚Äôs Paan Place. Its was a perfect way to end this awesome exploration. 

We confer our heartfelt thanks to Sankalp Bhai for introducing us to the best veg street food offerings.

Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

One of the things I love the most about travel is that destinations are never just one thing. They‚Äôre multi-layered and diverse. A prime example of that is India, a country I‚Äôve now visited three times. The states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, which I explored in March of 2019, are so different from other parts of the country, from the people to the culture to the landscapes to the food. It‚Äôs so exciting to get more of a sense of what India is and I‚Äôm thrilled to share this gorgeous and unique region with you!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

My first night in the Assamese city of Jorhat continued as my friend Rishi and I headed out on a nighttime street food tour I will never forget! Jorhat is very close to China, so there are lots of Chinese and even Mongolian influences in the cuisine there. I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste them for myself!

First, we headed to Break Time to get some momos. These momos are steamed first and then fried. A rich and spicy red sauce with pepper and chilies is made and the momos are stir-fried with it. These momos weren‚Äôt too hot and I loved the red sauce! They were the best fried momos I‚Äôd ever had. They were still crunchy on the outside and super juicy in the middle. The chicken inside was minced and perfectly cooked. They‚Äôre super filling and were like spicy, Szechwan-inspired momos. I was in love with them! You get a massive plate of them for only 60 rupees, or roughly $0.86 U.S.

Next, we headed back out and got some Vada Pav at Delhi Chaat House. Vada Pav is a potato fritter that is served on a bun with chutneys and is sometimes referred to as an Indian burger. I‚Äôd had it before in Mumbai and Pune and couldn‚Äôt wait to try it again. It was served with mustard, sweet sauce, coriander chutney, and a spicy sauce. The sweet sauce was so tasty. The bun was super fluffy and the spicy sauce was really hot! I also loved the coriander chutney. It was an amazing potato mash sandwich! It only cost about 40 rupees, or about $0.58 U.S.  

After that, we continued our street food tour by heading back out and getting some spicy chicken wings at Seev‚Äôs. They use the second spiciest peppers in the world, ghost peppers, in their wings. There was a honey glazed sauce on it that contained the peppers. The chicken wasn‚Äôt that hot but was super juicy. The heat made my lips tingle a little bit as I continued eating.

We also got some double-marinated chicken tandoori drumsticks, which had a thick, white sauce on them. I loved the smoky flavor and the glaze was so creamy and cheesy. I was in love with them! I added some mint chutney to them which was great. The sauce was like a soft brie cheese. Our total there came to 450 rupees ($6.49 U.S.): 250 ($3.60 U.S.) for the wings and 200 ($2.88 U.S.) for the tandoori drumsticks.

Next, we were back on the streets of Jorhat to get some spicy pani puri! Pani Puri is my favorite Indian dish of all time and my mouth was all set for a spicy version of it! They‚Äôre made of leavened, hollow flatbread that is filled with an aloo (potato) mixture, chilies, onions, pani (spiced water), and a spicy sauce. It was super hot and really good. I loved the crunch and chunks of potato. I‚Äôd never had pani puri this spicy! It costs 10 rupees ($0.14 U.S.) for 5 puris and the vendor keeps giving you more until you say you‚Äôre done.

The vendor also gave me a dry one without pani that I liked even better! I could honestly eat pani puri forever. The dry ones without the pani were so fantastic! I loved them so much. They were both spicy and sweet and had an incredible flavor combination. And even though it‚Äôs 10 rupees for 5, the vendor actually gives you an extra one for free!

Our final destination was Ice Station, where we got some rose lassi. I hadn‚Äôt had lassi in a while and I wanted to cool my mouth off after the spicy pani puri. It was delicious and milky and more like a shake. They put nuts on top, which add a nice crunch. I‚Äôd had a thicker lassi in Amritsar but I really liked this one, too. It had a nice rose flavor and helped me beat the fiery feeling in my mouth, so it did the trick! 

I hope you loved my nighttime street food tour of Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment. Also, please subscribe to my channel.

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you‚Äôll find in this video:

Z√ºrich, Switzerland

Caf√© Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I‚Äôve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossm√ºnster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn‚Äôt realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Z√ºrcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It‚Äôs quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don‚Äôt want  to miss when you‚Äôre in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

1284,D59Ld3KKM6M,LONDON STREET FOOD,"LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre‚Äôs food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats ‚Äì with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London‚Äôs top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What‚Äôs to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian‚Äôs family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather‚Äôs hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you‚Äôre getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",Food

Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It‚Äôs a delicacy!

So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. 

Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.

First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.

For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.

Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.

How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!

Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.

1289,OyxWVJQUC18,World Famous Hyderabadi CHICKEN BIRYANI | Biryani MAKING & Tasting,"The Hyderabadi Biryani needs no detailed introduction. This glorious delicacy is a staple for the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct from its popular counterparts because of its distinct aroma, taste, texture and the mode of preparation.

With the essence of Turkish, Mughlai and Arabic influences in it, the Hyderabadi Biryani has been an integral part of the Hyderabad‚Äôs culinary tradition since a long time. In this culinary exploration, we have set out to savour the dazzling aura of this majestic dish at some of the most famed destinations across the city. We are happy to be accompanied by our gracious host Sankalp Vishnu who is an acclaimed food critic and food expert.

We tried Hyderabadi biryani at two eminent places-The Lucky restaurant and the Bawarchi restaurant. Our intention was to understand the nuances or fine tuning of the variations in the Hyderabadi biryani as adopted by these joints. 

Our first stop was the Lucky restaurant that serves one of the best versions of the Kachi Gost Ki Biryani. We got the opportunity to witness the making of a batch of Hyderabadi Biryani at their wonderful, aromatic kitchen. The seemingly easy procedure entails an astute understanding of the dynamics of its cooking, perseverance and dexterity. The genial owner for Lucky restaurant walked us through the process sharing all the details of their prized preparation. We then tried the Nalli Biryani along with some other delectable meaty wonders. The feast ended with the lusciously amazing Khubani ka Meetha a dessert that‚Äôs exclusive to the city.

The next day we went to the acclaimed Bawarchi restaurant to try their version of the Hyderabadi Biryani. In recent years it has emerged as favourite destination for the same. The beautifully done Chicken Biryani was worth all the reputation. It ticked all the boxes of parameters that make the magic of a biryani work. A distinct feature of the biryani here was the pleasantly notable presence of the shah jeera flavour in it. Here we also tried the Hyderabad famous Double Ka Meetha and the Kaddu ka kheer. The latter one was the best.
 
While winding up this Hyderabadi biryani trail we couldn‚Äôt but wonder at the flamboyant stature of this apparently royal dish that rules the heart of the masses in and beyond this city.

 We are truly grateful to Sankalp Vishnu for his cooperation.

ADDRESS: Talatamaty City  
OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) 

Four miles outside of Madagascar‚Äôs capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 

ü•£RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 

ü•°CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin.

2. TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + Koba
ADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry 
OPEN: Varies 

Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. 

ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 

üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. 

Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.
üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA

1291,2RBRUF,Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok (Chinatown) in Jakarta - DELICIOUS Indonesia Food!,"‚ñ∫Check out 50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...

Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.

Since we were staying at a hotel (here‚Äôs information on the hotel I stayed at:)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn‚Äôt take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta‚Äôs Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.

The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.

One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.

We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.

It probably wasn‚Äôt the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!

Here‚Äôs the list of the things we ate and the prices:

Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)
Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)
Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) 
Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)

Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) each
Fried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)
Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged? Do you think?

Hope you enjoyed the Indonesian street food tour of Glodok and Fatahillah Square, I sure enjoyed eating it!

1299,YvlYjLPgrCE,Street Food in Ghana - GIANT CHOP-BAR LUNCH and West African Food Tour in Accra!,"This was an incredible day of street food in Ghana!
‚ñ∫Check out Jay: https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She‚Äôs a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she‚Äôs incredible. Check out her Instagram () and YouTube (). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What‚Äôs key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David () and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem!
 
We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.

After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.

Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:

Hummus Acramawi
Price - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate

Almond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)

Shawarma - 26 ILS ($7.26)

Total price - 100 ILS ($27.89)

It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.

Thank you again to David () and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!

1307,EoYFFbVKX5E,Disneyland FOOD REVIEW! Best & Worst Foods,"I visited the happiest place on earth Disneyland! Disneyland is known for its attractions and rides, but I didn't go there for that. I went to go on a food adventure to see what best and worst foods they served in Disneyland. After touring the food stalls at the park, I had to get some real dinner because eating the food at the park didn't fill me up as much. So I went to eat some Chinese food at one of my favorite restaurants in San Gabriel.

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

ü¶ê Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

üí∏PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

üêüTakamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo‚Äôs finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

Talad Rot Fai (‡∏ï‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏î‡∏£‡∏ñ‡πÑ‡∏ü), also known as the Train night market in Bangkok, or Talad Rot Fai in Thai, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok - this branch located at Ratchada. Here‚Äôs a map link: 

By the way, this is Part 2 of this Night Market Thai street food tour. You can watch the gigantic tom yum challenge here: 

The market is known for its unique Thai street food, some of the snacks and dishes which are invented there and you won‚Äôt find anywhere else in Bangkok.

Laeng Saeb (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö) at Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant (‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á) - Laeng saeb, a dish of pork bones and ridiculous amounts of green chilies is one of the most popular Thai street food inventions at Talad Rot Fai, and this is mainly what I came to eat. The restaurant is located at the back of the market, and they have a few different sizes you can choose from.

XXL Laeng Saeb (‡πÄ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏ã‡πà‡∏ö) - Price - 599 THB ($18.96) - We went straight for the XXL size, a massive platter of pork bones, soup, insane amounts of green chilies and the soup broth. Of all the Thai street food I‚Äôve eaten, this is one of the most unbelievable and insanely giant street foods of Thailand I‚Äôve ever seen or eaten. Although it‚Äôs way more than I ever care to eat again in one sitting, it‚Äôs actually a really good dish.

Crispy butter (‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö) - 35 THB ($1.11)
Stir fried ice cream (‡πÑ‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î) - 69 THB ($2.18)
Coconut shake (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô) - 35 THB ($1.11)

And that completed this Thai street food night market tour of Talad Rot Fai. It‚Äôs well worth a visit, and you can of course, order smaller sizes of laeng saeb when you‚Äôre in Bangkok. Enjoy!

Thank you for watching this ultimate Kenyan street food tour in Nairobi! I met up with my friend James who took me around to a few of his favorite spots to eat.

Kawangware, Nairobi, Kenya

Here's most of the food we tried on this amazing tour of Nairobi:

Ann Restaurant - Dagoretti Corner - This small street food stall on Dagoretti Corner in Nairobi serves all sorts of Kenyan / East African foods. Their chapatis are especially good, and their Lake Victoria  sardines fried with tomatoes.
Chapati
Dagaa - Lake Victoria sardine
Matumbo - stomach stew
Githeri - beans and maize
The guy sitting across the table - ‚Äúyou should not eat beans and sardines together, or you‚Äôll have gas.‚Äù
Total bill - 1,050 KES ($10.39) - we paid for 4 or 5 guys eating there

Stomach Clinix -  This was  the best  food stop of the day, a neighborhood meat shop that James took me to that specializes in cow head soup. The grilled tongue was also spectacular, but the soup was the best.
Total price - 200 KES ($1.98)

Dagoretti Market -  After the meat, we took a walk over to Dagoretti Market. After browsing around for a while, we stopped for another plate of mixed Kenyan food, mostly dengu, which are mung beans. It was simple, but quite good.
Dengu - mung beans
Total price - 300 KES ($2.97)

Unity Cafe Hotel - We met up with some of James' friend in Kawangware, and went to eat across the street from their shoe shop. The mandazi mix was the highlight of this Kenyan meal.
Total price - 600 KES ($5.94) for all

Cow foot fry - Next we headed over to Oscar who makes cow food soup, fry and boil. He was a very friendly man, and showed me his entire process of making cow foot soup. It was delicious!
Total price - 450 KES ($4.45)

Kenyan street food - To end this Kenyan street food tour of Nairobi we had to eat one of the ultimate Kenyan fast food meat treats. You'll see these types of grills all over the streets in the late afternoon throughout Nairobi. You just choose what you want, it's cut on the chopping board, and you stand and eat.
Esophagus
Intestines
Mutura - minced meat sausage
Mutura - blood sausage
Udder
Total price - 200 KES ($1.97)

Thank you for watching this ultimate Nairobi street food tour!

1328,S2UBy8bkgyE,What Japanese Prison Food is Like ‚òÖ ONLY in JAPAN,"Japan has some amazing prison food, which should be no surprise. Inmates are served healthy, nutritious meals of grilled fish, salads, rice and soup - which are actually healthier than most school lunches around the world! Would you like to try what prisoners eat? There's a prison in Hokkaido that serves authentic meals to the public and that is where I went -- Abashiri. 

Abashiri is in the very north of Hokkaido and is famous for its prison. Their ""Bangaichi Shokudo Diner"" is the only restaurant that serves authentic prison food in Japan, the ingredients the same as the penitentiary nearby. The meals will probably surprise you! 

Prison Food Menu:
SET A: Pacific Saury, 2 salads, barley rice, miso soup (780 yen / $7.00)

It's called the ""secret meal"" because Japanese Prisons are very restrictive with access to the outside world. However, Abashiri is dfferent and they've opened up prison life to the public and it's worth a visit. 

We also get a tour of today's prison cells in Japan. They have tatami mats, futons, TV, toilet and window. There are private cells and cells for 6 or more inmates. Japanese inmates typically eat their meals in their cells. 

The Japanese prison life is regimented, the schedule the same everyday. Wake up at 6:40am and lights out at 9:00pm. 
Meal time is three times a day for 20 minutes. 

Where is Abashiri, Japan? 
It's in Hokkaido's north, a 90 plane ride from Tokyo's Haneda Airport.

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

I'm in Tel Aviv with The Hungry Tourist food tour eating some the best pitas, street foods, and local restaurants they have in this country.

We started at a MUST try in my opinion at a true farm to table restaurant called Igra Rama Brenner St 2, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel

Then it was for a rainbow pita sandwich called Sabich and one of the BEST places for that is Sabich HaSharon Tuval St 34, Ramat Gan, Israel

After browsing the local market it was off the lunch at Azura with over 50 DISHES! 
Mikve Israel St 1, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel

The next day it was dinner at the world class seafood restaurant  Pescado Martin Buber St 1, Ashdod, Israel

and for a midnight snack it was skewers at Jasmino which is a must try! Allenby St 99, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel

1337,8Ug1MnU6LK,Unprocessed -- how I gave up processed foods (and why it matters) | Megan Kimble | TEDxTucsonSalon,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. n January of 2012, Megan Kimble was a city-dwelling 26-year-old‚Äîbusy and broke, living in a small apartment without so much as a garden plot to her name. But she cared about food: where it came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body. So she set herself a challenge: She would go an entire year without eating processed foods. In this talk, she discusses what makes a food processed and how those processes impact our bodies and communities.

Megan Kimble is the managing editor of Edible Baja Arizona, a local food magazine serving Tucson and the borderlands, and is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times. Her book, Unprocessed, about her year of eating only whole, unprocessed food, is forthcoming from William Morrow in 2015. Follow along at megankimble.com. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Food

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:

1359,CyI5JBR,7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After),"DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center () in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. 

It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. 

You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! 

Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. 

Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.

1360,HyGPqS29X,Eating BALUT for the FIRST TIME- Philippines Street Food,"Eating Balut for the first time. Balut is a 17 day old duck embryo and popular filipino street food. Trying balut was difficult, I had to pull feathers and bones out of my mouth! Later, I took a self-made Philippines Street Food Tour trying Ihaw-Ihaw which is grilled chicken intestines and the famous Lechon, a whole roasted pig. It could have competed with the best lechon in the Philippines! Although eating Lechon for the first time was absolutely delicious, eating balut was terrifying!

To make this philippines street food tour, I asked local filipinos what their favorite filipino foods were. They were all egging me on to try Balut. Get it? EGGing me on? Haha. I am a lover of exotic foods but this was definitely the strangest filipino food I have ever tasted! Always, they said we couldn‚Äôt leave Boracay without trying one of Boracay best foods, the Balut!

We loved our time in the Philippines and I enjoyed the food in the Philippines even more! Be on the lookout for more Philippines travel vlogs because we have more coming your way.

1366,WhU40m-6uU,15 Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD!,"We all know Gordon Ramsay is famous for screaming insults and spitting out food, but there are times where Gordon Ramsay is actually nice and is impressed by the food! We put together a list of 15 times when Gordon Ramsay actually liked the food! Like we‚Äôve seen in our two previous videos, it does happen. It‚Äôs just pretty rare. That's why we continued to search high and low so we could show more of those happier times in Gordon‚Äôs life.  

Most chefs are incapable of satisfying Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs sophisticated needs, but every now and then a chef manages to blow Ramsay away. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but we‚Äôve found the rare instances where Gordon Ramsay actually enjoyed the food. Just like we‚Äôve seen in our past videos, Gordon Ramsay has had a few moments where he actually liked the food that other people have prepared for him. We‚Äôve done some additional research and found 15 more Times Gordon Ramsay Actually LIKED THE FOOD from other people on shows such as MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, and The F Word.

‚û°Ô∏è Subscribe to BabbleTop: https://bit.ly/2Uu3HPe

Fast food restaurants have become essential in the daily lives of many people. But recently, more and more people are avoiding them because of the greasy and high-fat foods. With mainstream fast food restaurants adding vegetarian and vegan options to their menu, like the Beyond Burger a plant based meatless patty, they are looking at a changing landscape - not only in menu but in technological innovations. While no one is going to knock Mickey D‚Äôs off the throne just yet, here are the fast food restaurants and companies that are paving the way for the menus of the future.

If you enjoyed this list of the top 10 fast food restaurants of the future, then comment:   

TIMESTAMPS: 
 Salad and Go
 Cultured South
 Veggie Grill
 Freshii
 Impossible Foods
 Cafe X
 By Chloe
 Eatsa
 The Herbivorous Butcher
 Next Level Burger

SUMMARIES:
- Who says salads can‚Äôt be a part of a drive-thru menu? Well, thanks to Salad and Go‚Äôs innovativeness, you don‚Äôt have to consume a daily donut and coffee for breakfast (and fries, like some people do).
- Cultured South is not serving Beyond Burgers nor any other innovative plant-based meat. Instead, this casual restaurant is a kombucha taproom. Kombucha is what the ancient Chinese referred to as the ‚Äúimmortal health elixir.‚Äù 
- Just like The Beyond Burger‚Äôs healthy patties, Veggie Grill‚Äôs burgers are also plant based which primarily consists of pea protein. They also have ‚Äúchicken‚Äù sandwiches on their menu which consists of soy, pea, and wheat protein. 
- Freshii is way ahead of its vegan food chain rivals. This fast food restaurant has been serving salads, wraps, and bowls for nearly 15 years. Started in Canada in 2005, it now prides itself in having more than 300 franchises worldwide.
- Due to The Beyond Burger‚Äôs success, the race for the best vegan burger has started. While not a restaurant, Impossible Foods joined the battle in the search for an innovative vegan food that could be loved by avid carnivores, too.
- For Cafe X, many questioned if a robot can really make a quality cup of coffee but indeed, many customers gave rave reviews. Starting to serve people in 2017, the Cafe X robot did not fail. 
- If you are a foodie and a social media buff rolled into one, then By Chloe is a must visit. It‚Äôs not just another vegan food place serving healthy food, but the whole setup itself is optimized for social media. You might call their food instafood instagood with all the bright colors, attractive interior designs, and tempting menu.
- Eatsa is another food chain that is ahead of its time. Hungry customers can place their order on the iPad on display inside the shop. Although cashiers were replaced by tablet screens, human workers still prepare and cook these orders in the back.
- The Herbivorous Butcher is a vegan butcher shop owned by siblings Kale and Aubry Walch. Wait, a vegan butcher? Yes, you heard that right, a butcher shop but without the slaughter. It‚Äôs actually a vegan shop that started at home.
- True to its name, this burger joint brings the burgers to your table to the next level. It‚Äôs not because they boast that their burgers come from an ethical farm or because they‚Äôll serve them just like an expensive restaurant does. It is because their burger is plant-based. Its ingredients are composed of pea protein, yeast extract, and coconut oil.

Find more kitchen ideas you should know by heart:
-    Check out the quickest way to peel boiled potatoes: score potatoes around the middle before boiling; places scored potatoes into a saucepan and boil; rinse with cold water the potatoes when they are ready and slip off the peels
-    If you want to cook something cool ‚Äì try to prepare tornado potatoes. Push a wooden skewer through the center of each potato. Using a sharp knife carefully cut in a spiral motion from one side to other. Now divide the potato slices to give them some space and bake
-    If you need to quickly cut avocados, use a grill rack
-    Replace a knife with dental floss to cut a cake

1387,f9P5Phj0TFY,A taste of conflict: The politics of food in Jerusalem - Street Food,"The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to three different faiths: for Jews it is the site of their first holy temple; for Christians it is the scene of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection; and for Muslims it is the location of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven.

A site of vast historical and religious significance, this beautiful city is also a tragic one - fought over for centuries and coveted by millions who have never set foot in it. It is at the heart of the ongoing and seemingly irresolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and everything there is overshadowed by politics.

Jerusalem's old city enthralls with its bustling markets and vibrant street life, but inside its walls, tensions are never far from the surface. History is a dimension of the present and there is little unity to be found in a city which Palestinians regard as their occupied capital.

In the struggle for the soul of a city, even food - a marker of identity, an expression of history, culture, and values - plays a part, and the roots of certain foods are fiercely debated.

For Palestinians, denied a state and with a national identity which is constantly undermined, food plays an even greater role in defining who they are.

Almost half of Israeli Jews come from Middle Eastern backgrounds where their parents and grandparents lived alongside Arabs in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Morocco. Many dishes are a reminder of the shared history and culture of Arabs and Jews - something easily forgotten in today's divided politics. 

In a city where Israelis and Palestinians attach great meaning and symbolism to food - whether religious, political or both - we visit a unique place, Eucalyptus, which is jointly owned by Palestinians and Israelis.

There, we sample dishes made by an Israeli Jew, a Palestinian Muslim, an Armenian, and a Palestinian Christian who, as 'Chefs for Peace', cook together to bridge religious and political divides. Convinced that ignorance about the other is at the heart of the conflict, the chefs try to educate people about others' history, traditions, and culture through the medium of food. 

This film was first broadcast on Al Jazeera English in July 2008.

1388,6HngwHe3QCA,"Village Food in AMAZON RAINFOREST - Lemongrass Ants + EXOTIC Energy Drinks! | Manaus, Brazil!","üé•Street Food Tour in Rio de Janeiro: https://youtu.be/TlWDF3BfUdo
üçåBanana Chips available now!! https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens
üëïT-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

MANAUS, BRAZIL - During my food trip to Brazil there was no place I wanted to visit more than the Amazon Rainforest. We flew to Manaus (if you look at a map, Manaus is directly in the heart center of the Amazon). The jungle, the unique dishes and fruits, and the people made it incredible.

Exotic fruit tasting - One of the things that you have to do when you‚Äôre in Brazil, especially in the Amazon is sample all the unique and indigenous fruits of the region, some that are only available there. We started with mari-mari, an amazing long pod fruit and have inga (ice cream bean fruit) and birib√° - wild sugar apple. All the fruit - 10 BRL ($2.55)

Manaus is a pretty big city, especially for being in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. They have a big market, full of fruits, vegetables and fish. We headed straight for some tucum√£, a type of palm tree fruit that‚Äôs essential in the local diet.

Jenipapo - Along the way we also tried some jenipapo, a pretty unique fruit.

Tucum√£ sandwiches - Sandwich shop owners better take note! Tucum√£ sandwiches are a true Amazonian food and they are delicious. Along with the palm fruit they were paired with cheese and fried sweet banana. It‚Äôs a perfect breakfast and way to start the day in the Amazon. Price - about 10 BRL ($2.55) per sandwich

Tambaqui fish - Tambaqui is a fish from the Amazon that‚Äôs known for having ribs - seriously almost like pork ribs. We decided to get a fish to bring to the village since we weren‚Äôt sure what they‚Äôd have al the village.

Amazon village - We didn‚Äôt really have a plan, we were just going to find a boat driver and ask him to take us to a village and see if anyone could cool. So we got a boat, and our boat driver asked if they were home and if we could invite ourselves in. We arrived completely unplanned and unannounced and it turned out to be an outstanding learning experience and fun time with an amazing family in the Amazon.

Along with the food we brought, the family mixed up about 4 different exotic drinks - some of them known in the Western world as ingredients in trendy energy drinks - but here in the Amazon of Brazil they are consumed regularly.

It was such an awesome Brazilian Amazonian food meal with the family followed by a time of drumming and dancing, football, and finally a swim in the river. It was an extraordinary day in the Amazon of Brazil.

1390,NGxcr_Z8D,5 Must-Try Japanese Food Experiences in Tokyo,"Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 

1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 

2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 

3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 

4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 

5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. 

*Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside!

1392,PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

1404,03vWwqYPf60,Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary,"There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?

Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.

1409,HwRYUmToqLY,BEST AMSTERDAM FOOD EVER! | Top 7 Dutch Street Foods üá≥üá± Albert Cuyp Market,"Eating delicious food such as waffles, cheesy chicken sandwich, raw fish, gouda cheese & more! THUMBS UP & SUBSCRIBE!! 
Eating the best Dutch street food in Amsterdam

PATRON: 

In this video, I show you where to find the very best Amsterdam food! I take you on a walking tour of the Albert Cuyp Market in Amsterdam where I taste test many different Dutch street food items. 

Named after a 17th century painter, Albert Cuyp, the market has since become an institution for this bustling European city. Located on the Albert Cuypstraat (that is the name of the street) between Ferdinand Bolstraat and Van Woustraat...the market's central location makes it the perfect place to stroll through on the way to a nearby museum or on the way to a picnic. 

Visiting the Albert Cuyp Market is a definite must-see when you're in Amsterdam! Another plus is that this market is great for travelers on a budget because there are a lot of Amsterdam food options (traditional Dutch dishes) that can be had for under $3 Euro. 

A list of Amsterdam street food I ate at the Albert Cuyp Market:

I began with my favorite item, the stroopwafel. When I think of Amsterdam food, stroopwafel is the first thing that comes to mind. Essentially it is a waffle, but it's nothing like an American waffle. This unique pastry is made with flour, butter and sugar, but the real excitement is in the middle of the waffle. The waffle is cut in the middle (which is a miracle because it is so thin!) and then copious amounts of brown sugar syrup are knifed onto it, and then it is sealed once again. Stroopwafel is best eaten warm! The predominant flavor is cinnamon and the waffle itself is both crisp on the outside but soft inside. It's absolutely delightful and it tasted a lot different than I was expecting. 

Next, I tried some raw herring called Nieuwe Herring which translates into ‚ÄúNew Herring.‚ÄùThis means that the fish has either been caught that actual day or the day prior. Nieuwe Herring is another must try dish when it comes taste testing Amsterdam food! Since it was herring season in the summertime (until around Sept), I decided to try out some fresh herring the Dutch way (with pickles and raw onions). It was absolutely incredible! I am now a herring addict.

After this I drank some fresh pressed raspberry juice mixed with blackberries and orange juice. You can find juice stands all along the market. A normal glass of juice costs around 1 EUR. 

Then after this, I moved onto a spicy chicken sandwich at Benny's Chicken. This food stand claims to have the best chicken in all of Amsterdam. After tasting their spicy chicken sandwich covered in cheese, I have to admit that is was really good! The pieces of chicken are succulent and juicy. Definitely a delicious sandwich if you're craving something cheesy!

After this I bought some dates at Ron's Notenbar. Notenbars (which literally translates into ‚Äúnut bar‚Äù) are a very common sight in Amsterdam. There are a couple notenbars at the Albert Cuyp Market and they all offer different items which is nice. Duchies love their fresh fruits and nuts, especially as a mid-day snack! I was impressed by their selection of dates, but I highly recommend getting a couple bags of different dried fruits and nuts.  

Next, I purchased some aged gouda cheese at a cheese shop called Daalder Kaas. They sell traditionally ripened cheese and an array of aged gouda cheeses. I selected an aged gouda cheese which I thought was nice and creamy. It had a sharp flavor, but wasn't overwhelming. 

I thought all of the Amsterdam food I tasted at the market was wonderful!  Make sure to come earlier than 5pm as some vendors tend to pack up around 3pm (or when they sell out of the goods). It's best to arrive in the early afternoon.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Flint (Bill Hader) and the gang discover an island of living food animals.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Picking up precisely where its hit predecessor left off, Sony Pictures Animation's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 finds Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) invited to join the Live Corp Company, and use his gift for invention for the good of mankind. Just as young Flint prepares to go to work for his hero Chester V (voice of Will Forte), however, the young genius learns that his water-to-food machine is not only still functional, but it's also started cross-breeding animals with food. Now, in order to prevent a growing army of ""foodimals"" from escaping isolation on an island and wreaking havoc on the mainland, Flint and his loyal group of friends will have to do battle with such delicious, but deadly, hybrids as the ferocious tacodiles, slithering apple pie-thons, and vine-swinging shrimpanzees. Saving the world from these rampaging monstrosities won't be easy, but if anyone is up to the task, it's Flint and company. Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn takes the reins for this sequel also featuring vocal contributions by Anna Faris, James Caan, Kristen Schaal, Terry Crews, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt.

1428,xnKaOL2IBPY,"Food as Medicine | Michael Greger, M.D. | TEDxSedona","According to the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest study of disease risk factors in history; funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) the #1 cause of both death and disability in the United States is our diet. Cigarettes now only kill about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet appears to kill hundreds of thousands more. The good news is that means we have tremendous power over our health destiny and longevity. Healthy eating has the potential to not only prevent, but reverse some of our leading causes of death including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Why, then, is nutrition not the #1 thing taught in medical school? American physician, author, and speaker on public health issues, particularly the benefits of a whole foods, plant-based diet and the harms of eating animal products. He is a vegan and the creator of NutritionFacts.org. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Food
1429,5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters‚Äìled by Alice Waters‚Äìvoiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

1437,TJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

SUMMARY
-A glass of juice contains 5‚Äì6 teaspoons of sugar. The dissolved sugar immediately gets absorbed into the bloodstream, which is bad for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
-Yogurts with fruit contain a lot of sugar, fat, and calories, which all lead to children becoming overweight. It also increases their risk of getting diabetes.
-Flakes, muesli, and other similar cereals contain is a lot of sugar. All the healthy elements of corn, wheat, and oats are removed during production ‚Äî only the carbohydrates are left.
-Honey can cause an allergic reaction, and sometimes honey contains bacteria, which can lead to a serious infectious disease called botulism.
-Grapes are large and slippery, and a child could choke on them. Grapes are also very difficult for a child‚Äôs digestive tract to process.

1444,go_QOzc79U,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.

Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.

Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.

1450,_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It‚Äôs definitely something worth knowing if you‚Äôre struggling with excess weight. 

 The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.

Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called blood glucose. If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.

TIMESTAMPS: 
What glycemic index is 
Foods that digest slowly 
Foods that digest moderately 
Foods that digest quickly  
Foods that don‚Äôt have a glycemic index value 
What about pizza?  
Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 

Music by Epidemic Sound  

SUMMARY: 
- The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.
- If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.
- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.
- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.
- There are also foods that really don‚Äôt really have a glycemic index value since they don‚Äôt contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.
- If you‚Äôre having pizza that‚Äôs just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!
- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they‚Äôre processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",Food
1469,4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTY
We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes. Yummy!

Take 4-5 rounds of brie, cut the tops from brie and wrap in the dough and place the brie ‚Äútower‚Äù in the center of the baking tray. Put jacket potatoes around, spray potatoes with olive oil and add any spicy you like and bake for 60 minutes. Yummy! Another cool idea is to cool camembert with vegetables.

1495,P2BVyHOdFU,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they‚Äôre sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! 

No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they‚Äôre cooked.

SUMMARY:
- Whether they‚Äôre in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.
- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it‚Äôs reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave‚Äôs high temperatures.
- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won‚Äôt kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.
- When it‚Äôs time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.
- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food‚Äôs protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.
-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it‚Äôs probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they‚Äôre prepared, they‚Äôre more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. 
- While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they‚Äôre incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop ‚Äúblue baby syndrome,‚Äù which can be fatal.
- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don‚Äôt forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.

""Let thy Food be thy Medicine and thy Medicine be thy Food."" -- Hippocrates

That's the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film 'Food Matters' from first-
time Producer-Directors James Colqhuoun and Laurentine ten Bosch.

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with
our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. 'Food Matters' sets about uncovering the trillion dollar
worldwide ""Sickness Industry"" and giving people some scientifically verifiable solutions for curing disease naturally."" - James

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

'Food Matters' is to be launched globally via the internet using full screen video technology.

The film's official website can be found at ",Food

Do you know WHAT you are eating? You may think you are eating 100% pure food, but the answers is alarmingly different. Take the fast food restaurant Subway for example. Their chicken only contained 50% real chicken. The rest was soy fillers. But soy fillers are not too bad compared to fake eggs. In 2012, scammers in China produced eggs cheaper than the supermarket by creating a mold where they combined resin, starch, coagulant, and pigments. Talk about fake food! But wait there‚Äôs more! Also in China, a gang of traders bought a whole bunch of rat, fox, and minx flesh and sold it as lamb! Check out the rest of these 25 insane food scandals that actually happened.

Do you like cooking?
I definitely do, but sometimes I don't have much time for this because of a busy and tiring day. Does it sound familiar? Don't worry! In this video you will find simple and delicious recipes for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Don't forget about desserts :)

1. Healthy breakfast idea
You and your family will love this healthy breakfast. Also, it looks amazing! You will need:
- peach
- yogurt
- apple strips

Put some yogurt on a plate and place a half of the peach in the middle - it looks just like a fries egg, but definitely is 10 times healthier and full of vitamins! Now add some apple strips as a healthy french fries version. Yummy!

2. Egg in the clouds
To cook this delicious breakfast you will need:
- eggs
-cheese

Separate egg whites from egg yolks. Whip egg whites into a white foam, add some grounded cheese. Place the mixture on a cooking tray, put the yolks on top and cook it in the oven at 230c for 3 minutes. The eggs look unique and amazing!

3. One minute chocolate pastry
This is probably the fastest and easiest pastry idea you can cook in just one minute. Take a piece of puff pasty (you may buy it in the store or make it yourself). Now put a chocolate bar in the middle and wrap it in the pastry. Make a braid pattern for decoration. Add some nuts on top. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 200c. So delicious!

Yo man...
Yo I know you see me here dude!!
I've been waiting here like 10 minutes, man!
No, no no... this is MY parking space man.
What you need to do is put your little hybrid in reverse, 
And go out the way you came in.
WHAT?!?!
Yo its about to get REAL in the Whole Foods parking lot man...

Chorus  (with feeling)

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
I got my STEEL and you know it gets sparked a lot
Im on my grind homie... It's on my mind homie!
These fools with clip boards are lookin' at me like they know me!

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
You know the DEAL with the little shopping carts they got...
Check out what I say, it happens every day...
It's how we LIVE on the west side of LA!!

Verse 1

... Im ridin' slow in my Prius...
all leather, tinted windows... you cant see us!!
Everybody's trying to park, you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode... can't even hear the engine (Shhhhhhh)

Just then I saw a spot open up, 
My timings perfect... Im creepin' up...
But then this other dude tried to steal it going the wrong way
Yo man, I've had a LONG DAY!

Chorus 
(same as before)

Verse 2

Now I'm on this inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken, Kale Salad and a Lemon Twist.
Some girl in yoga pants is lookin at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir for under twenty!

Then I take it to the cheese counter, Humboldt Fog?
We just ran out sir!  Really Dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself...
I've been on edge ever since they took Kombucha off the shelf...

Chorus

(same as before)

Verse 3

This Busters on his iPhone talking to his friends, 
Picking up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse.
You're the most annoying dude I've ever SEEN brah... 
Could you PLEASE move?  You're RIGHT in front of the Quinoa.

Damn, I'm about to check out.
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.
The express lane is moving hella slow...
Man, these fools don't know... that shit is getting REAL....

1518,W2L_02p-xn,6 High Estrogen Foods MEN SHOULD AVOID!,"These are 6 High Estrogen Foods Men Should Avoid to build muscle, lose weight, and get lean. Some foods should be limited and others should be completely avoided. Instead of increasing estrogen most men want to learn how to increase testosterone naturally & fast. By learning how to decrease estrogen levels, weight loss becomes much easier.

The next food that you'll want to limit to keep your estrogen levels down is wheat and grain based products. These foods are extremely high in a type of xenoestrogen known as zearalenone or ZEA. ZEA is molecularly similar to estrogen and acts like estrogen in the body. One study examined the effect that ZEAs had on a drug called Letrozole, which is specifically designed to lower estrogen levels in the body. Bodybuilders will often take it get to really low levels of body fat. The researchers found that, even small amounts of ZEA negated the effects of Letrozole. That‚Äôs a powerful indicator of the estrogen boosting effect of all those ZEA‚Äôs that are found in wheat and grain products. As well as the ZEA problem, wheat also contains phytoestrogens. They‚Äôre found in the wheat germ which is the reproductive part of the wheat seed. These phytoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptor sites in your body‚Äôs cells. In a study that was designed to investigate the combined effect of wheat germ and a breast cancer treatment pharmaceutical it was noted that one of the side effects of wheat germ was that it increased estrogen receptor activity of MCF-7 cells. However, refined grain products remove the germ, making them slightly less of a problem when it comes to estrogen. Overall though, you should limit your consumption of wheat and grain based products. Our third estrogen food type to avoid is processed carbs and refined sugars. Hopefully, you‚Äôve already cut back on these types of foods if you're trying to bring your body fat levels down. But there‚Äôs an extra reason to ditch these types of carbs. And it has to do with that powerful blood sugar regulating hormone, insulin. As well as causing you to store more body fat, insulin lowers your body‚Äôs levels of what is known as sex hormone binding globulin. The job of this globulin is to bind the two sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen, together. When it's doing its job properly, you will have limited amounts of free estrogen in your body. But, when it's stopped from doing its job, the opposite will be the case, your free estrogen levels will be much higher. It‚Äôs the insulin response that occurs when you eat refined sugar foods that causes the interference in the activity of sex hormone binding globulin. An interesting study that focused on women showed that drinking sugar laden sodas increased estrogen levels. The interesting thing was that increased estrogen levels did not occur with either diet sodas or fruit juices. Researchers believe this is due to the fact that diet sodas don‚Äôt contain refined sugar and fruit juice contains natural fruit sugars. Another estrogen related problem with sugar consumption is that, eating too much sugar leads to an increase in stored body fat. Fat cells excrete estrogen. So, the more fat cells that you have sitting around your body, the more estrogen you‚Äôll have floating around as well. This is additional to the estrogen produced by the endocrine system. So, rather than reaching for a sweet sugar saturated treat, do your estrogen levels a favor and opt for foods that are high in proteins, fiber and healthy fats. Our fourth no go food for estrogen is beer. I know, this is a tough one. Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt drink it at all, but if you want to get really lean and maximize your muscle mass and strength, then you gotta‚Äô cut back on the booze.  Here‚Äôs why. As you know beer contains hops. But what are hops? Well, they're actually the female part of the hop plant. They‚Äôre a preservative that has been added to beer for

1520,RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,

What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. 

About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.

At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.

'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.

Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!

Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.

James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten Bosch

Producer / Directors 'Food Matters'

PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  

""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'

""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com


 ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""
- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series


 ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""

1531,QygPpMeXEV,Making Global Research Connections Through Food,"For many faculty members, summer is an especially important time for research. For some scholars in fields such as anthropology and linguistics, research is conducted living and working among people in different communities. Sometimes those communities are close to home, and other times far away from the University of Rochester, both geographically and culturally. 

Researchers such as Timothy Dye‚Äîa medical anthropologist and social epidemiologist at the Medical Center with an appointment in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology‚Äîand Nadine Grimm, an assistant professor of linguistics who specializes in African languages‚Äîhave conducted field research in remote communities where a key component of their work is gaining the trust of the people there. 

There are many dimensions to gaining that trust, but among the most basic involves the sharing of food.
 
Dye recalls his first real-life lesson in the importance of eating local foods while working in remote communities. He was in the Kashmir region of the Himalayas about 30 years ago conducting surveys about diarrhea in the village children. After entering the first house, he turned on his tape recorder and began asking family members questions about their beliefs about the causes of the diarrhea and their treatments. But the interview was not going particularly well.

‚ÄúA woman ladled some chai into a metal cup and handed it to me. Sanitation was a huge issue in the village, so naturally I wondered about the milk and water that were mixed into the tea,‚Äù says Dye. ‚ÄúBut I remembered a basic rule about doing field research in anthropology, which requires us to accept any offering of food or drink, lest we offend someone and risk an entire research project.‚Äù

Dye drank‚Äîthen gulped‚Äîthe warm tea, which he found to be rich and creamy, as well as satisfying in the cold, high-altitude environment. At that point, everyone broke into a more natural conversation, leaving the research questions for another‚Äîand more successful‚Äîday.

""For some communities, eating certain foods means that you're a part of that nationality,"" says Dye. ""If you drink chang, a type of homemade beer in Tibet, it's said you're Tibetan.""
 
Depending on where he is working, Dye‚Äôs diet has included, in addition to chang, snakes, wildebeests, insects, giraffes, and bats. 

Nadine Grimm, who has studied languages in remote areas of South America and Africa, has enjoyed a similarly wide palette, which has included, for example, monkey and python.
 
""Eating local foods makes it easier to connect with indigenous communities,"" she says. ""Once they offer me food, I feel accepted, which makes it easier to do my research.""

It isn't just the culinary choices that are different in these remote communities; it's also the attitudes some cultures have toward food‚Äîand that includes the Bagyeli Pygmies, who are hunter/gatherers. 
 
""For the Bagyeli Pygmies, the entire day is preoccupied with how they'll get food,"" says Grimm. ""Sometimes they're unlucky and don't have enough food for themselves, let alone for a guest, which is why I stay in a nearby town and limit my meals with them.""
 
Because the availability of food varies greatly with the Bagyeli, dining with the community takes on added significance. ""They gradually offered me better food items, she says, ‚Äústarting with steamed bread fruit and working their way up to wild meat."" 

‚ÄúEating local‚Äù in much of the United States is, of course, a trend more often than a necessity. It‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs captured the interest of many college students, including at Rochester. 
 
This past semester, Dye and Grimm shared with undergraduate students some of their thoughts and experiences about eating locally‚Äîglobally‚Äîover a cooking and eating demonstration incorporating a couple of their favorite foods from Tibet and from Swahili-speaking regions of Africa. 

With increasing numbers of students coming to the University of Rochester from outside the United States, it's not uncommon to break bread with people from a variety of cultures that diverge widely from typical American traditions. For the students who took part in this cooking demonstration, it's just one more chance to broaden their perspective, and their palette.

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below‚Ä¶

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.

1548,3n8gZvEew9g,"8 Popular Foods We Don't Eat Anymore, Here's Why","What foods do you buy daily? How about SunnyD? Or maybe congealed salad is the thing you can't live without? Yup, these foods are so unpopular now! However, just 20‚Äì40 years ago they were flying off the grocery store shelves!

SUMMARY:
- TV dinners first stepped onto the scene in the 1950s when Swanson was looking for a way to sell their Thanksgiving food leftovers. They came up with the idea of serving ready-made food frozen on a convenient tray.
- If you ever ate dinner at your grandma‚Äôs house as a kid, you probably tasted the stuff once or twice. Gelatin was first used in dishes back in medieval Europe and was partly made from the collagen in animal bones.
- Back in 1968, many kids could be seen sipping on a cold bottle of SunnyD as a part of a well-balanced breakfast ‚Äî and it was anything but. SunnyD tasted super sweet because it was primarily made of corn syrup and contained less than 5% juice. 
- One Hi-C Wild Cherry juice box contained a whopping 27 g of sugar, which is more than the American Heart Association recommends grown women ingest in a day ‚Äî and these were intended for kids! 
- Back in the late ‚Äô80s and ‚Äò90s, Bubble Tape was a fan fave! But ever, since sugar-free gum became more popular and oral health, became more of a priority, this sugary sweet gum just wasn‚Äôt as desirable anymore.
- Ambrosia salad was usually found at family gatherings back when you or your parents were younger. This sweet salad actually came onto the scene back in the 1800s and usually featured special sweet treats that only appeared on special occasions. 
- Once people realized how bad trans fats were for them during the ‚Äò90s, Crisco stopped being used as often.
- It wasn‚Äôt until the 1950s that cottage cheese became incredibly popular. It‚Äôs very mild in flavor and isn‚Äôt super high in fat, which was appealing to people from the ‚Äò50s into the ‚Äò70s.

1561,KoUcEcz1dM,8 Foods that Are Actually Damaging Your Kidneys,"Have you ever noticed that final powerful spray of water at the carwash before your vehicle gets a rapid blow dry? The water jets pulverize any remaining remnants of dirt.

That‚Äôs one way to view how our kidneys work. Their job is to flush out toxins from the blood by way of urine. The National Institutes of Health reports that our kidneys filter an excess of 200 quarts of blood daily. That translates into 2 quarts of waste each day. They don‚Äôt get holidays or weekends off; they work day and night.

Thankfully, our kidneys can wash away impurities while retaining vital nutrients floating around in our blood. Keeping our internal filters healthy and functioning properly is invaluable for nourishment and detoxification of our bodies. 

So naturally, whatever we eat and drink has a dramatic impact on our kidneys‚Äô health. A steady diet of unhealthy food and drinks can strain their performance, and put us at risk.

The good news is, it‚Äôs never too late to improve your diet and lifestyle, even if your kidneys are already impaired.
 
In today‚Äôs video we will see how our kidneys react to too much consumption of 8 different foods and beverages.

1. Red meat
We‚Äôve all heard that protein is good for our health. But too much of anything can be harmful. For example, a diet that is high in red meat, which contains lots of animal protein, can damage our kidneys. The reason? Our kidneys need to metabolism this protein. 

When there‚Äôs a conveyor belt of rich protein headed toward the kidneys for cleansing, they  just can‚Äôt keep up with the pace. When kidneys can‚Äôt eliminate waste products, there will be a build-up of acidic residue in our body.
It‚Äôs always good to talk to your health care professional about the diet that‚Äôs right for you.

2.  Alcohol
Just like eating too much red meat can strain our kidneys, the same is true with too much alcohol; they will be unable to properly filter our blood. Also, too much alcohol can cause dehydration. This creates a domino effect: if our blood is dehydrated, our cells and organs will not be able to function properly.

3. Table Salt
While our bodies require sodium to maintain proper fluid balance ‚Äì especially in our electrolytes - an excess amount will cause kidneys to retain water. Too much salt can also increase the amount of protein that is eliminated in urine.

4. Caffeine
Caffeine is a stimulant which millions of people depend upon every morning to help them become fully awake. But all of that caffeine in coffee, tea and sodas can jolt your kidneys into overdrive. The stimulant accelerates blood flow, which in turn increases blood pressure.

Caffeine has another effect ‚Äì it can lead to dehydration, just as salt can. Too much dehydration can lead to kidney stones. Most health experts recommend you drink no more than 2 cups of coffee or 3 cups of tea daily. Soda and energy drinks are beverages you may want to eliminate completely. Another source of caffeine is cocoa, which should also be consumed moderately.

5. Artificial Sweeteners
Refined sugar has had a bad rap lately. That‚Äôs why companies began creating artificial sweeteners. It may sound better for our health, but they can still negatively impact kidney function. Try instead to steer away from artificial sweeteners and use stevia or honey to flavor your food and beverages.

6. Dairy Products
While dairy products are an excellent source of protein, they should be consumed in moderation, especially for anyone who has kidney disease. The reason?  Too many dairy products will increase calcium in urine which can lead to kidney stones. Also, as kidneys are overworked, they won‚Äôt be able to regulate protein waste and it will rise to an unhealthy level.

7. Carbonated Beverages
Sodas and energy drinks are usually the chief instigator for kidney problems; they are loaded with caffeine, sugar or artificial sweeteners. They may taste better than thirst-quenching water or lemon water but they aren‚Äôt providing any health benefits for your kidneys.  
 
8. Genetically Modified Foods (GMOs)
In recent years, crops have been the recipient of various forms of herbicides and pesticides. This includes everything from strawberries to rice.

Rescuers Discover The Heartbreaking Reason This Cat Only Accepts Food In Bags
Homeless cat only accepts food in bags so she can feed her only kitten

Life on the streets isn‚Äôt easy for cats. While house cats enjoy a pampered existence, strays forced to live in the elements struggle every single day to survive.

If you‚Äôve ever fed a stray cat, then you know just how rough life can be for them‚Äîand how appreciative they are of free meals. While they might be wary of people, if there is food to offer, strays will scarf it all down as quickly as they can before bounding off to safety.

That‚Äôs what makes this story so special. When a volunteer from a local animal shelter noticed the strange way one cat was eating food, she decided to follow her. What she discovered changed the way she saw every animal around her‚Ä¶

Contaminated meat is getting into the frozen patties of the company's best-selling burger. To find out why, he'll have to take a journey to the dark side of the All-American meal.

Leaving the cushy confines of the company's Southern California boardroom for the immigrant-staffed slaughterhouses, teeming feedlots and cookie cutter strip malls of Middle America, what Don discovers is a Fast Food Nation of consumers who haven't realized it is they who are being consumed by an industry with a seemingly endless appetite for fresh meat.

1582,dcB5VU93AII,Homemade Onion Rings - Super Crispy Easy and Delicious,"One of my all time favorite fast foods are onions rings. I am, however, fairly fussy in terms of how they are made and how they taste. In my opinion, they need to be super crispy, have some spice, and heat. Many onion rings I have had just do not come up to standards. In light of this, I decided to make my own recipe. Believe me, these onion rings are super crispy and delicious. I love them with burgers or hot dogs or just solo.

As always, you can adjust the spices by adding more or less. It is your call.

Give them a try and let us know what you think.

Ingredients:

1 large onion sliced into 1/4 inch pieces
3/4 cup of all purpose flour
1/4 cup of corn starch
1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper

1585,298JtrczB8,You Won't Believe This! | ULTIMATE THAILAND FOOD TOUR,"From ""tiger juice"" to Chinese dessert on the street - I try it all out! 
Subscribe to our channel: https://goo.gl/2OsFKV
Check out yesterday's vlog: https://youtu.be/fEckOV0PowU

In this video, I explore the many street food stalls at the Saturday Night Market in Chiang Mai Thailand. You don't need to pay someone money to go on a Thailand food tour. Simply head down to one of the night markets in the city and explore the different food stalls on your own. You'll pay pennies to eat like a king (or queen!) 

Here is a list of food items I ate during this Thailand food tour:

Tofu in Ginger Tea  (Douhua) - This Thailand food tour starts out at a tofu cart that sells a Chinese influenced dessert. The silken tofu (which is made by the owner) is dished out into steaming hot bowls filled with a spicy ginger tea. Slightly sweet, and full of flavor, this is one of my favorite desserts to eat at night. 

Cassava with Shredded Coconut ‚Äì This thai dessert is absolutely delicious! Made with a type of potato like vegetable and steamed to perfection, this chewy candy is coated in shredded coconut and tastes wonderful. Grab a bag of these little guys and munch on them as you walk through the many busy lanes of the night market. They taste similar to a Turkish delight, except less sugary. They are the perfect snack if you are craving something sweet and subtle. If you like boba, or tapioca pudding, you‚Äôll love this awesome yellow Thai dessert. 

Tiger Juice ‚Äì This drink is green in color and tastes like grass. It's made with pennywort which is a plant that has a very medicinal flavor, but it can grow on you. If you're leading yourself on a self-guided Thailand food tour, make sure to pick up a glass of this exotic juice that is suppose to make you live forever. I would say that the flavor is not so bad if you keep drinking it, but overall not my favorite Thai drink. It‚Äôs more of an experience than anything else. 

Thai Spring Roll ‚Äì Such a cliche, right? But popular for a reason! The Thai spring roll which is commonly found to be found fried is one of the most delicious snacks you can feast on while strolling through this awesome night market. The more you buy, the cheaper the price so load up on some thai spring rolls! 

Local Thai Wine ‚Äì This is not exactly the best wine I've ever drank, but it's still good (considering the price is only a buck). It tastes kind of like a wine cooler, definitely has a bite to it, and will get you buzzed if you drink more than one. Try out all the different flavors such as lychee and ginseng. Made locally by the Chiang Mai University, which is pretty cool. I really like this wine booth and recommend checking it out. The lady who runs it is very nice and there are tons of people to chat with while you sip on your drink. 

I hope you enjoyed my Thailand food tour. This is by no means a comprehensive guide, as there are a million food vendors at this market. The cool thing about Chiang Mai is there is an assortment of food from desserts, snacks, and full on meals (so you‚Äôll find yourself content no matter what you are craving!) Expect to pay anywhere between 15 cents and 2 dollars (depending on what you are purchasing). Seafood tends to be on the higher end of prices while Thai desserts and finger foods are extremely cheap. Noodles are always dirt cheap so make sure to try out some delicious pad thai which can be made with pork, chicken or tofu.  Check this place out!

1633,7YvJB0n16I,Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing (Free Simulation),"Lean Simulation:  Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing

This video shows a preview of a Push versus Pull computer simulation model by The Big Lean Simulation Library:  



From here, you can obtain the full version of the video tutorial, the simulation model itself, and how-to instructions for demonstrating the model.  You can show this as part of your Lean Six Sigma course offerings (LSS White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt.).  Lean and Lean Six Sigma consultants can also use it as a tool to sell your Lean consulting work to management and executives.  Advanced practitioners will already know the concepts but will appreciate the ability to show them to others in an easy to understand format.

This simulation consists of three scenarios.

Scenario 1:  This shows a push manufacturing system.  The first workstation produces a run of 100 parts.  The second workstation processes those parts at a slower rate.  As a result, the ""pushed"" parts add excess inventory and Work-In-Process (WIP).  In addition, the first workstation experiences a quality problem after 30 documents.  As a result, about 70 defective parts are produced before the downstream workstation catches the problem and tells the first workstation.

Scenario 2:  In this scenario, we use a Pull based kanban system to process parts only when the second workstation is able to process them.  As a result, key metrics for Work-In-Process and quality are dramatically improved while still producing at the same rate.

Scenario 3:  Travel time is reduced, thus allowing fewer kanbans.  All metrics are improved further.

The final view shows optional discussion bullet points.

1638,F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled.

1668,2jIbhRPCJG4,Google Glass on the Manufacturing Floor using Proceedix,"AGCO‚Äôs Jackson, Minnesota manufacturing team has incorporated Google Glass to audit finished product before it is shipped to dealers for consumer purchase.   Wearable technology allows the Quality team to thoroughly inspect tractors while improving standards in safety, checklist documentation, issue trending and throughput.  Although Glass still feels as futuristic of a technology as flying cars, AGCO has embraced the elaborate electronic devices, making use of voice activated commands and eye winks as daily tools.  In addition to the efficiency that voice and eye motion bring to the process, the simple fact that the quality technicians are no longer carrying devices, allowing for hands free inspection and focus on safety has increased throughput, safety records and checkpoint reliability.   Checklists are now smart, following model specifications and presenting instructional diagrams and text that drive the technician‚Äôs response and follow-up actions.  Every point on the checklists requires action and offers a level of detail that allows on the job training for newer employees and newly released model specifications. 
As Agricultural equipment companies continue to competitively advance their technologies to help farmers maximize their yield, the complexities to produce the machines increases.  As the world also continues to battle a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, solutions like wearable technology, offering immediate access to instructions and information will become required.  The company‚Äôs that realize this and find solutions will be in positions to not only succeed in, but win, the global markets. ",Manufacturing

We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. 

Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don‚Äôt produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.

This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950¬∞C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.

A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",Manufacturing

1697,qIcV09YbAE,Artificial intelligence in manufacturing: Game changer or just another hype?,"Most people agree that artificial intelligence will have a huge impact on the way Europeans will produce and consume in the future. However, there are differing views on what the European Union can do to tap the full potential of AI in manufacturing and while coping with possible challenges.

The debate is often driven by pessimistic scenarios such as disrupted industrial structures and mass unemployment. This rarely reflects the daily life of European manufacturers who develop ways to use AI for a more efficient and clean production ‚Äì and who need a political framework for the use of such technologies. In April, the European Commission published its AI strategy with the aim to facilitate the uptake of AI in Europe. 

EURACTIV organised this workshop to discuss how AI is used by manufacturers and the regulatory framework at the Union level. Questions included:

- Will AI disrupt industry, or will it be just another step in its evolution?
- Do we need new EU legislation, for instance new liability rules?
- Is the Commission‚Äôs recent Communication on AI appropriate and strong enough?
- Is the European industry competitive compared to superpowers like the US or China in the field of AI? Does the EU risk lagging behind?
- Will AI lead to mass unemployment in Europe? What can be done to prevent it?",Manufacturing

1709,HiMzDP3pU,The New Manufacturing: Ted Hall at TEDxRichmond,"Ted Hall, founder and CEO of ShopBot Tools, Inc., first got excited about digital fabrication 20 years ago. Ted wanted a digitally controlled tool that would cut plywood parts for backyard boatbuilding projects. In trying to find such a tool, he learned that the CNC (computer numerically controlled) technology of the time was heavily industrial and oriented to high-volume manufacturing. Ted's idea, which would become ShopBot, was to create a digital fabrication tool that was instead oriented to use by individuals and small shops. A tool that took advantage of the technology's capability to cut, drill, sculpt, machine, carve, or trim with high precision and in relation to a digital model -- but that made sense in a small shop for making one object or many, and that empowered individuals through the new technology with enhanced capabilities to express their creativity in projects of all sizes and using a wide range of materials.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Manufacturing

1724,fRYIJuq6l4,Manufacturing Day 2013,"Manufacturing sure ain't what it used to be. Gone are the days where every manufacturing job meant backbreaking and/or dangerous labor. Though a great amount of skill is still required these days to produce consistently high quality products in large volumes, many production environments are now equipped with both safer materials and high-precision, lower-force robotics that allow us to build more intricate devices than ever before.

Here at SparkFun, we embrace our robotic friends that work tirelessly to help us produce thousands of circuit boards and electronics kits each day for the innovators, tinkerers, creative technologists, and tech education providers all across the world. We appreciate our machines for their quirks (robots aren't perfect, you know) so long as they don't frown upon our own. True to our D.I.Y. ethos, we have always believed that it is far more satisfying to manufacture our own product designs rather than outsource them to someone else. And, as is to be expected, we have learned many valuable lessons as the demand for our circuit boards and kits has grown over the years. But through those lessons, we continue to improve. We believe that our success lies in our openness to trying new things, dedicating ourselves to an insatiable appetite for high quality products, and being true to who we are without regard for ""industry norms.""

It is always rewarding to see the endless stream of amazing projects from the D.I.Y. community come to life, with the circuit boards and kits that we personally built here in Boulder, CO, playing a small role in those creations! A big thank you to those of you who share with us and the world what you have built and what you have learned through your own designing and building! And thank you for being as truly unique and geeky as we are...

It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:   

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

How To License A Product - Licensing vs Manufacturing

I recently did an interview with Stephen Key, the author of ""One Simple Idea - Turn Your Dreams Into a Licensing Goldmine While Letting Others Do The Work"". As the title suggests, Stephen comes up with ideas and lets others manufacture them for him, all while making money.

Stephen goes over numerous aspects of taking an idea from just that, an idea all the way to cash in the bank. In this video Stephen goes over How To License A Product - Licensing vs Manufacturing

In this Video on How To License A Product - Licensing vs Manufacturing You Will See:

- How to license a product
- When to license vs. manufacturing
- What you need to do first when you have an idea
- Why you want to license

He's a passionate advocate for the ""maker movement"", who believes that micro-manufacturers, like his small cut-and-sew factory in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood, are the future of American manufacturing. He earned his MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1989, and says he's learned over the years that being an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley doesn't have to mean working in the tech industry.

1774,3s1QPleyJGU,Motor Rewinding and Re-manufacturing at KOFFLER,"http://bukaymedia.com This depicts a wide variety of motor rewinding and rebuilding processes that takes place by the skilled technicians at KOFFLER in San Leandro CA. The variety and size of motors and generators they work on is immense. The video includes the random winding of a multiple-strand stator coil, layer winding for a rotating field coil, and the random winding of a rotating excitor rotor. Progress is followed showing various stages of lamination being replaced in a 3,500 kW generator. Commutator undercutting is demonstrated using a laser guided tool on a large rotor. The winding and insulating of a variety of AC and DC armatures is demonstrated, along with the wedging and insertion of coils in a variety of newly wound stators.

Finally, you will see the testing of the output voltage of a 5,000 kW generator to assure that all 3 phases are the same.For more information, go to .",Manufacturing
1775,f-tQYcZGM4,üì∫ Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".

""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""

Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.

Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.

For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.

The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.

In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.

In that way, the book continues to resonate.

But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?

We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.

The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".

""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""

Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?

""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""

Aman Sethi put it like this:

""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""

Bleaching powder is also called calcium chlorohypochlorite because it is considered as a mixed salt of hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid. Bleaching Powder is an oxidizing agent and the activity is measured in terms of available chlorine, which is the same weight as that of gaseous or liquid chlorine that would exert the same action as the chlorine compound. Bleaching powder is used to whiting or removing the natural color of textile fibers, yarns, wood pulp, paper and other products by chemical reaction and also is an additive in the scouring powder preparation as germicide.

Bleacing powder is calcium hypochlorite (Ca (OCl) 2). It is a one of the major chemical industry in the world. Limestone and chlorine gas are used as raw materials to manufacture bleaching powder which is used as a disinfectant and as an oxidizing agent. Bleaching powder show different reactions.

URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/USL...
Description: The Portuguese cowbell is a traditional idiophone percussion instrument that provides an unmistakable soundscape in rural areas. Alc√°√ßovas is the main manufacturing centre where the cowbells, traditionally used by shepherds to manage livestock, are made. The practice is transmitted from father to son and requires a series of processes before the handmade iron pieces are polished and fine-tuned. Yet the tradition is becoming unsustainable as new grazing methods, cheaper industrial techniques and fewer cowbell makers are leading to its demise.

1839,WTZFMEDyvYk,How to Find a Supplier on Alibaba & Find a Chinese Manufacturer,"This video tutorial will teach you how to find a supplier on Alibaba & find a Chinese manufacturer. 

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ Free Ebook - Make $10,000/Month Online: 

Here are our step-by-step instructions on how to find a supplier on Alibaba:

Step 1: Go to Alibaba and find the search bar. Type in the name of a product that you are interested in selling. In this video I used vitamin pills as an example. 

Step 2: Because a lot of suppliers have duplicate listings on Alibaba for the same item (because it increases their presence in the Alibaba search engine) you will need to filter the results by clicking on ‚Äúbrowse by suppliers.‚Äù 

Step 3: To filter the results down further, search by ‚ÄúGold Suppliers.‚Äù Most suppliers will do this because it has become basically a prerequisite for having new buyers contact them. It doesn‚Äôt cost them much money to do this, so the results will only be filtered by a small amount. 

Step 4 (OPTIONAL): If the list of suppliers is still too long, then click to filter the results by ‚Äúassessed supplier.‚Äù This is only necessary in very popular niches where you have a large number of suppliers that you need to filter down to a manageable amount. 

Step 5: Contact 10-20 suppliers at least. If you have time, then contact more. The more you contact, the better.

Here is the email template referenced in our video tutorial on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: 

""My name is [INSERT NAME] from [INSERT BUSINESS NAME]. Our company director asked me to contact your company about working together on a lucrative, long-term venture. We are a company that sells products related to [INSERT NICHE HERE] and we do over 2 million dollars in sales each year. We‚Äôre looking to expand our product range and create a profitable partnership between your company and ours.

We are planning to purchase [INSERT ITEM] to our product line. It would need to meet these specifications: 

* Specification (e.g size)
* Specification (e.g. quantity)
* Specification (e.g. colour)

We have been researching different companies in China that manufacture [INSERT ITEM] and we think that your company could be a great supplier for it. We would like to get some more information and have a few questions that we would like you to please answer: 

* Can we please get a sample of the product as soon as possible. Can you please let us know how much you will charge for the sample, including Express shipping to [INSERT COUNTRY], zip code [INSERT ZIP CODE]? We would like to pay with PayPal. 
* How long will it take to receive the sample?
* What types of packaging do you usually use for this product?
* How long does it take to manufacture once an order has been placed?
* What is the product-per-unit cost including shipping via Air Express to the United States, ZIP code 85043?
* Do you accept PayPal for the full-order?""

We would be very grateful if you would contact us with answers to the above questions as well as any additional policies that we may need to know. We would also like to discuss with you further about doing a sample order for the product.

We are hopeful that we can start a mutually beneficial relationship.

Alternatively you can email me back at this address: [INSERT ADDRESS]

Here are some final tips to keep in mind when you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba to manufacture your Amazon FBA private label products: 

Tip #1 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Don‚Äôt judge the supplier/manufacture by their Alibaba response rate.

The Alibaba response rate only takes into account how fast they respond within Alibaba‚Äôs email system, and it doesn‚Äôt take into account how fast they reply to personal emails. This is not a good indicator of how responsive they will be to private communication, which is all you should care about.

Tip #2 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Avoid manufacturers that try to vet your business. 

If a manufacturer comes back and starts asking questions about your business, clearly skeptical of the size of your company, it is best to move on. Manufacturers that do this will usually decline to work with you as they are only to work with other large companies, so you don‚Äôt want to waste your time. 

Tip #3 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: It is OK to work directly with a sales rep - if they offer you a better deal. 

When you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba, you‚Äôll discover that sales reps often have inflated prices (due to commission cuts). But occasionally, a sales rep will have a better relationship with a factory and so are able to negotiate lower prices. They will also often have good english, making communication easier. Vet sales reps and treat them as equals during the process of picking and choosing the right supplier.",Manufacturing

1841,04uKmaKa8DU,Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth),"What will the future of manufacturing be like?

Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.

Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.

Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.

Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. 

So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.

Anything, anywhere

In the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.

Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it‚Äôs not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.

Here are some points in the production process that assure the highest quality possible for modern windows:
All glazing panes are tested and examined by hand for best quality assurance.
Special equipment is used to seal the panes together for an airtight unit.
The latest gas-filled technology fills the panes with Argon or Krypton gas for added energy-efficiency.
Thermal welding technology ensures new frames have a continuous seal to minimize air and moisture transfer.
Windows are tested and examined before they leave the warehouse to ensure they meet stringent CSA standards.

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.

1877,TjqRJZswl-U,Exclusive tour of LG's OLED R&D and manufacturing facilites in South Korea,"Check out our CES 2019 coverage! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...

LG brought Digital Trends along on an exclusive tour of several of its labs and factories halfway around the globe in Seoul, South Korea -- and we‚Äôre bringing you inside with us.

Make no mistake: Much of what we saw was confidential information, of the ‚ÄúI could tell you but I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù sort. But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.

The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world‚Äôs largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. 

We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn‚Äôt require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. 

The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it‚Äôs one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.

1879,nNHnnjW0d3E,ART IN MANUFACTURING | AMY PENNINGTON 2019,"Creating a direct mail artwork posted through 10,000 doors in Blackburn - artist Amy Pennington invited the general public to explore the manufacturing journey of an unassuming everyday object - the envelope.

Asking the general public to look out for the makers initials printed on the envelopes Amy encouraged a dialogue between strangers, from the ‚Äòreturn‚Äôer to the sender‚Äô. Usually a one sided conversation, questions posed to the factory workers explored the theme of ‚Äòwork‚Äô and revealed the perspectives of the machinists. Return to Sender is a sensitive look at how to subvert a mass produced object to create an intimate exchange.

In LMD, a weld track is formed using metal powder as a filler material which is fed, through a coaxial nozzle, to a melt pool created by a focused high-power laser beam. By traversing both the nozzle and laser, a new material layer develops with precise accuracy and user-defined properties.

Banana is one of the most widely consumed fruits and is grown across various countries. The majority of the bananas produced worldwide are consumed directly, while a small part is processed into banana powder, which helps in expanding its shelf-life. Banana powder is mainly used for producing milkshakes, protein powder, baby food, etc. Further, it finds applications in various food products such as cakes, instant foods, beverages, seasonings, etc.
Banana powder has taken consumers by storm, in light of its status quo of being gluten-free and a cheaper alternative to wheat powder. Greater solubility remains a key selling proposition of banana powder, as food and beverage manufacturers move past banana flakes and puree for the preparation of baby food products and breakfast cereals.

1958,qYP6f66M,THE THORIUM PROBLEM - Manufacturing & energy sector hobbled by thorium,"Thorium, Rare Earth Elements [REE] and Molten Salt Reactors [MSR] covered in brand-new book by Victoria Bruce! https://www.amazon.com/Sellout-Washin...

John Kutsch of Thorium Energy Alliance and Jim Kennedy of ThREE Consulting review the hazards maintaining U.S. current thorium policy. Heavy Rare Earth Element mining is impeded. Energy sector innovation is stifled. Thorium is less dangerous, less radioactive, and less easily metabolized than many elements we are exposed to on a daily basis.

Current regulation assists China's capture of high-tech manufacturing sector. Current regulation protects incumbent U.S. [light] rare earth producers who DISPOSE of thorium and valuable heavy rare earths in tailing ponds. Current regulation does NOT facilitate growth of U.S. economy.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle recognize reform is needed. No one is willing to introduce legislation to address the thorium problem. China continues to capture high-tech manufacturing jobs. U.S. private corporations are unable to pursue thorium an an energy resource.

1962,QHZbMd4ydk,Manufacturing: Push or Pull? - Whiteboard Wednesday,"Learn more at: http://www.fishbowlinventory.com/quic.... Push or pull? It's a fundamental question for manufacturers. Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.

Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.

Silicon Manufacturing & The Perfect Wafer | Inside the Fab | Intel",Manufacturing
1969,Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.

PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.

Improved Time Management

Operators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.

Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!

Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!

Increasing Operator Productivity

An example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.

The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.

Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.

System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.

Improved Motivation

Staff motivation can be improved in two ways.

Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.

Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",Manufacturing

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

2015,VeLsJtId_g,MANUFACTURE OF THE BOFORS 40mm ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN AT CHRYSLER BOFORS GUN TEAM 58844,"Support Our Channel : https://www.patreon.com/PeriscopeFilm

Made as part of the WWII war effort by Chrysler, THE BOFORS GUN TEAM shows the manufacture of the Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun then in use by the Navy and Army. This was one of the most stunning manufacturing feats of the war, since the Bofors was an extremely intimidating weapon to mass produce and many believed it could not be produced in quantity, in time to make a difference in the war. Within 3 years however Chrysler had shipped over 40,000 complete mechanisms and 75,000 barrels. 

At , the Swedish-designed gun is seen in its ""Americanized"" configuration -- made for mass production in a Chrysler factory. At , new blueprints are made from Swedish originals which were in metric measure. At , a diagram shows how the manufacture of the gun was split between Dodge, DeSoto, Plymouth and other Chrysler plants. Production lines are seen for breech casings and other parts in the gigantic plants, which were formerly used for automobile manufacture. At , blocks are shown being made through mass production techniques. At , quality inspection is made of the blocks. At , the manufacture of the gun barrel is seen. At , breech blocks are assembled and tested. 

The Bofors 40 mm gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun,is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remain in service to this day, and saw action as late as the Gulf War.

In the post-war era the original design was not suitable for action against jet powered aircraft, so Bofors introduced a new model of significantly more power, the 40 mm L/70. In spite of sharing almost nothing with the original design other than the calibre and the distinctive conical flash hider, this weapon is also widely known simply as ""the Bofors"". Although not as popular as the original L/60 model, the L/70 remains in service, especially as a multi-purpose weapon for light armored vehicles, as on the CV 90. 
 
In order to supply both the Army and Navy with much greater numbers of the guns, Chrysler built 60,000 of the guns and 120,000 barrels through the war, at half the original projected cost, and filling the Army's needs by 1943. Over the lifetime of the production, their engineers introduced numerous additional changes to improve mass production, eventually reducing the overall time needed to build a gun by half; most of these changes were in production methods rather than the design of the gun itself.York Safe & Lock also produced the weapons, though its attempts to coordinate drawings across the program were unsuccessful, and this responsibility was transferred to the Naval Gun Factory in July 1943.There were many difficulties in producing the guns within the United States, beyond their complexity (illustrated by the use of 2,000 subcontractors in 330 cities and 12 Chrysler factories to make and assemble the parts).

2018,qCbYd8O8MU,Audi Smart Factory - Future of Audi Production,"Audi Smart Factory P-Tech Day. Subscribe.
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

Outsourced sales forces are, however, sometimes the best kept secret of all the tools manufacturers use to bring their products to market.

P&G is a fast-moving consumer goods company. We have several different BUs. So we handle the whole spectrum of a person's life stages.

Digital tools are simply critical for us to be able of the
delivering this manufacturing of the future. 

Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.

The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And, we have to be ready for that.

Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their hand
to improve their business results.

Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.

From our team rooms we went away from you know hard written
paper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.

One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings, energy savings, we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.

It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.

The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations, safety and quality.

Too often we provide a solution that is limited.

I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain. 
 
The people that we have worked with at GE when they say they're going to do something they really deliver excellence and they deliver it on time.",Manufacturing

2035,ZK9cJt3C_I8,What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?,"Let‚Äôs tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing ‚Äì planning flows, execution flows and monitoring flows.

Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions, shop floor execution systems, and manufacturing operations management (MOM).

Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants‚Äô production information, and integrate easily with equipment, controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility, control and manufacturing optimization ‚Äì from order placing, production inception, and process control to product output.

------

Flexware Innovation, Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields, lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it‚Äôs still a passion for our FlexDogs today, as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It‚Äôs one of the things we love most. Well that, and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena, but that‚Äôs a blog for another day.

""This is a very important step of this process because once you found a product that you want to sell or a niche or an opportunity that you want to sell on Amazon that you already deemed as profitable that you can make money from then the supplier piece is the next most important part.

You want to make sure that you find suppliers that have good prices, that will give you a great quote, that you can negotiate with and build a great relationship with, that you can order a certain number of units from, maybe a product from China or the United States. 

I will be showing you exactly how to do that.""

2056,DIL_OOF5FF,Silicon Manufacturing & The Perfect Wafer | Inside the Fab | Intel,"Meet Dave Pivin, a Failure Analyst Engineer at Intel whose job it is to continuously push towards the production of a perfect silicon wafer. As Dave puts it, it's like ""Looking in a million haystacks for a single needle"". 
 
 As silicon wafer production moves smaller and smaller, from 22 nanometer to 14 nanometer, imperfections in production are tough to see even with high-powered microscopes. Dave and his team of fellow scientists are charged with identifying the causes of these nearly invisible defects. 
 
 Check out Dave's story, and stay tuned for more stories ""Inside the Fab"" at Intel. Subscribe now to Intel on YouTube:

Silicon Manufacturing & The Perfect Wafer | Inside the Fab | Intel",Manufacturing
2057,J4qwK1KgL_,Philippines: Cebu Province: Illegal Gun-Manufacturing Centre - 1997,"Cebu province in the Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches and resorts.

But Cebu is known to Filipinos for its illegal gun-manufacturing centred in the city of  Danao.

Recently, the government has approved licences for two gun manufacturing companies  in Danao.

But some remain in operation even without a permit, and this is likely to continue.

UPSOUND: (Sound of rapid gunfire from Uzi-gram)

Byron Garcia is testing what he calls an ""uzi-gram"".

It's one of the products being manufactured by the Danao Arms Manufacturing  Corporation, or Damcor - the first licensed gun manufacturer in Danao City.

The city of Danao, in the Philippine central island of Cebu, has always been notorious  as the centre of illegal gun manufacturing.

Here, thousands of residents have been involved for decades in what is virtually  considered a cottage industry, making home-made guns, popularly known as ""paltik"".

By establishing Damcor, Garcia has legalised gun manufacturing in Danao. 

Damcor specialises on the 38-revolver, and is also producing machine pistols and  shotguns mainly to supply the country's security agencies.

Garcia has invested more than 40 (m) million pesos in Damcor, some of which were  spent on machines with state of the art  technology to produce some of the gun parts.

But most of the work is left for the 70 workers that Garcia has employed since his  company opened last year.

Most of their experience is based on what they've been clandestinely doing in their  backyard for years.

30-year old Lito Gonzales was into illegal gun making for ten years before he decided to  work for Damcor.  

Here, he earns about 600-dollars a month, and is free from the anxiety of being arrested  by the authorities.

SOUNDBITE: (Tagalog) 
""Now, we're okay here, because we don't need to worry about being arrested today or  tomorrow, that the police will arrest us because it's illegal to do guns outside. No  more.""
SUPER CAPTION:  Lito Gonzales, worker Danao Arms Manufacturing Corporation

But despite the entry of Damcor and another licensed gun company, Garcia believes  that the illegal gun- manufacturing industry in Danao will continue to flourish, mainly  because of the lack of political will to remove it.

SOUNDBITE:  (English) 
""Maybe it will change a bit. But it cannot totally eradicate the illegal business here.""
SUPER CAPTION:  Byron Garcia, President Danao Arms Manufacturing Corporation

And for most of the illegal gun makers in this city, making the ""paltik"" in their  backyards will surely be a hard habit to break.

For 20-year-old Julius Capuyan, it's the only job he's known since he was 13 years old.

SOUNDBITE:  (Tagalog) 
""There's no other way of life for us here. We'd rather live this way, illegally making guns.
SUPER CAPTION:  Julius Capuyan

Most of the people in Danao have relied on this illegal industry as their livelihood for  decades making the government's job of curbing the unlicensed gun-manufacturing  operations a difficult task.

A worm drive is a gear arrangement in which a worm (which is a gear in the form of a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the worm drive as a unit.

Like other gear arrangements, a worm drive can reduce rotational speed or transmit higher torque. A worm is an example of a screw, one of the six simple machines.

One of the major advantages of worm gear drive units are that they can transfer motion in 90 degrees.
A gearbox designed using a worm and worm-wheel is considerably smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90¬∞ to each other. With a single start worm, for each 360¬∞ turn of the worm, the worm-wheel advances only one tooth of the gear wheel. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the ""size of the worm wheel - to - 1"". Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm wheel reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 tooth gear to achieve the same 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 tooth gear to that of the 20 tooth gear, the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.
There are three different types of gears that can be used in a worm drive.

The first are non-throated worm gears. These don't have a throat, or groove, machined around the circumference of either the worm or worm wheel. The second are single-throated worm gears, in which the worm wheel is throated. The final type are double-throated worm gears, which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.[1]

An enveloping (hourglass) worm has one or more teeth and increases in diameter from its middle portion toward both ends.[2]

Double-enveloping wormgearing comprises enveloping worms mated with fully enveloping wormgears. It is also known as globoidal wormgearing. technology information technology news technology in education technology future technology innovation technology solutions bearing machinery cnc",Manufacturing

The Invisalign system is a combination of proprietary virtual modeling software, rapid manufacturing processes and mass customization, and virtually clear, removable appliances or ""aligners"" that are used to straighten teeth.

The Invisalign system is prescribed to patients through trained Invisalign orthodontists or general practitioner dentists (GP dentists). Align provides clinical education programs and the tools needed for orthodontists or GP dentists to offer Invisalign treatment options in their practices. Although treatment time varies by patient, on average a patient requires one full year of treatment - equivalent to 24 sets of Invisalign aligners.

Transcript:

Save time and money on the production of large-scale, high-value metal (titanium, tantalum, inconel, stainless steel, etc.) parts and prototypes with Sciaky's Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM‚Ñ¢) solution.

Transcript:

Imagine: From this, to this, in a fraction of the time and cost it used to take. With Sciaky‚Äôs exclusive Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing, or EBAM‚Ñ¢ for short, metal 3D printing is not limited by part size, material, or geometry. You can manufacture parts and structures that exceed 19 feet in length, 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 8 feet in diameter, made from virtually any metal, including inconel and stainless steels, and refractory alloys like titanium and tantalum.  

How does the EBAM‚Ñ¢ process work? Starting with a 3D model from a CAD program, Sciaky‚Äôs fully-articulated, moving electron beam gun deposits metal, from wire feedstock, layer by layer, until the part reaches near-net shape and is ready for finish machining. Deposition rates can range from 7 to 20 pounds of metal per hour, which is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than selective laser sintering processes that utilize messy powders. In addition, a dual wire-feed system can be utilized with the EBAM‚Ñ¢ process to increase deposition efficiency, as well as to easily switch to different deposition materials. 

So, whether you need to produce a functional prototype, or a run of production parts, the possibilities are virtually endless. 

Our technology partners include the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, Boeing, DARPA, Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.

Call the metal 3D printing experts at Sciaky today and find out how EBAM‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing ‚Äì can save you significant time and money on the production of your critical metal parts.

By contrast, in east and south-east Asia, the industry share has exceeded 30-40% while manufacturing is up 20-30%. India‚Äôs manufacturing share of GDP has not moved up at all, though between 2004 and 2012 manufacturing employment growth was reasonable. However, total manufacturing employment has fallen significantly between 2011 and 2016 by 10 million in just four years, especially in labour-intensive manufactures. This is the opposite of what was achieved in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. By contrast, in India the labour intensive manufacturing sectors like food processing, tobacco, textiles, apparel, leather, wood and furniture have seen a decline since 2012.

The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.

The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.

The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.

Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. 

Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

In combining additive and subtractive process capabilities, UAM can create deep slots, hollow, latticed, or honeycombed internal structures, and other complex geometries impossible with conventional subtractive manufacturing processes.  Additionally, the solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for welding of dissimilar metals.  This enables dissimilar metal cladding, production of custom metal matrix composites, and the ability to embed objects or sensors in a metal substrate.   Through the use of UAM technology, customers will be able to manufacture complex parts that have unique features and attributes not possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. In addition, parts currently made with traditional operations can be made with much less waste, an increasingly important factor as more expensive, higher performance materials see broader use.",Manufacturing

These guidelines provide minimum requirements that a pharmaceutical or a food product manufacturer must meet to assure that the products are of high quality and do not pose any risk to the consumer or public.

Good manufacturing practices, along with good agricultural practices, good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, are overseen by regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and other countries.

Good manufacturing practice guidelines provide guidance for manufacturing, testing, and quality assurance in order to ensure that a food or drug product is safe for human consumption. Many countries have legislated that food and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers follow GMP procedures and create their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation.

All guidelines follow a few basic principles:

Manufacturing facilities must maintain a clean and hygienic manufacturing area.
Controlled environmental conditions in order to prevent cross contamination of food or drug product from adulterants that may render the product unsafe for human consumption.
Manufacturing processes are clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are validated to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications.
Manufacturing processes are controlled, and any changes to the process are evaluated. Changes that affect the quality of the drug are validated as necessary.
Instructions and procedures are written in clear and unambiguous language. (Good Documentation Practices)
Operators are trained to carry out and document procedures.
Cross contamination with unlabelled major allergens is prevented.
Records are made, manually or by instruments, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the food or drug was as expected. Deviations are investigated and documented.
Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced are retained in a comprehensible and accessible form.
The distribution of the food or drugs minimizes any risk to their quality.
A system is available for recalling any batch from sale or supply.
Complaints about marketed products are examined, the causes of quality defects are investigated, and appropriate measures are taken with respect to the defective products and to prevent recurrence.
Practices are recommended with the goal of safeguarding the health of consumers and patients as well as producing good quality food, medicine, medical devices, or active pharmaceutical products. In the United States, a food or drug may be deemed ""adulterated"" if it has passed all of the specifications tests, but is found to be manufactured in a facility or condition which violates or does not comply with current good manufacturing guideline. Therefore, complying with GMP is mandatory in all pharmaceutical manufacturing, and most food processing....",Manufacturing

2159,Kslh8XUphJ,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017‚Äî The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI‚Äôs Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.

A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI‚Äôs Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).

The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",Manufacturing

Manufacturing in the United States fell to its lowest level since President Donald Trump took office, according to two industry analyses.

The U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to its lowest level in April since October 2016, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The ISM survey also found that its factory employment index had fallen by 11 percent since October 2016 and factory output fell to its lowest point since August 2016, Reuters reported. A separate survey by IHS Markit also found that May was the ‚Äútoughest month in nearly 10 years‚Äù for American manufacturers, IHS economist Chris Williamson told Bloomberg News, adding that the reduced production will also be a ‚Äúfurther drag on GDP.‚Äù

Business owners were quick to point to Trump‚Äôs trade wars with China and other countries as the leading cause for the slump in American manufacturing, which Trump claimed he would restore to its glory days.

‚ÄúNewly increased tariffs on Chinese imports pose an issue on a number of chemicals and materials that are solely produced in China,‚Äù one respondent said in the Institute for Supply Management Survey.‚Äù

The latest report from the South Korean government shows new jobs are finally on the upswing.

According to Statistics Korea Wednesday, the total number of employed people in May was around 27-point-three million... up 259-thousand on-year.
The increase was under the 200-thousand mark for 12 consecutive months until January,... but the figure started to improve in February.

Last month's uptick was mainly due to more new jobs in the health and social work sectors,... which jumped by 124-thousand.
Analysts say, this comes after the government created more public sector jobs in the field.
Jobs in accommodation and the food service sectors also saw an increase of 60-thousand...thanks to more foreigners visiting South Korea.
The employment rate among people aged 15 to 64 marked 67-point-1 percent....marking the highest for the month of May since data was first compiled in 1989.

On a grimmer note..., the number of jobs continues to decline on-year in the manufacturing sector, considered South Korea's key growth engine.
The number of employed people fell more than 70-thousand on year...and it has been falling on-year since April last year.
Analysts point to falling exports, especially to China, as the reason for the decline.
Latest data by Korea Customs Service show outbound shipments to China dropped by more than 26-percent on year during the first 10 days of June.
This is also related to a decrease in the number of jobs for people in their 30s and 40s in May...and this raises a red flag... as many people in that age range are supposed to be actively engaged in economic activities.

To improve the country's sluggish manufacturing industry, analysts suggest diversifying South Korea's export destinations.

Juul's rapid success has been widely associated with the rise of the vaping trend‚Äîspecifically among young people. The e-cigarette maker has been accused of targeting youth with its selection of candy- and fruit-flavored pods, sparking so much concern that the Food and Drug Administration placed sales restrictions on Juul's flavored nicotine products. 

However, it's no secret that not everyone agrees on the dangers of Juul; in fact, some argue that the devices are a healthier alternative to traditional smoking and can even help people kick their tobacco addictions. Today, we explore the polarizing views on this issue in Juul: One Nation Under Pod, the latest installment of our Complex News Presents docuseries. The episode includes statistics, statements from Juul and tobacco researchers, as well as interviews with vaping advocates and teenage Juul users.

Amid growing concerns over the health of the Korean economy,... the president's top aide for economic affairs says the country faces further challenges.
He says the slowdown of the global economy and prolonged trade disputes.... could be a source of headwinds in the latter half of the year.
Park Hee-jun has the details. 
The South Korean economy could continue to stagnate for longer than expected.
The President's Senior Secretary for Economic Affairs,  Yoon Jong-won told reporters at the Blue House on Friday,...   that the Korean economy faces growing uncertainties,... and they could also affect the second half of the year.
""There is more uncertainty abroad than we expected. The global economy is in a downtrend, while global trade and manufacturing are shrinking due to worsening trade frictions.""
Data show that business sentiment in the manufacturing sector is still on a downtrend,... though there was a slight increase in the first quarter. 
South Korea also reported its first current account deficit in seven years in April... at 660-million U.S. dollars.
But Yoon says the decline is temporary,... caused by a drop in exports and a rise in dividends paid to foreign investors.
He expects it to rebound within the year. 
On the employment front,... 200-thousand jobs have been added this year and the number of youth employed continues to increase.
However, jobs for key groups of workers in their 30s and 40s are disappearing. 
Some of the most promising figures are seen in the growth of new industries.
Exports in electric cars, secondary batteries and bio-health are going up.
And those fields are seeing new companies being started as well. 
The administration plans to keep nurturing these industries to drive the economy back up.
But the secretary also points to the 5-point-8 billion dollar supplementary budget bill... as a key part of the solution.
""Economic growth can be expanded and some 10-thousand to 20-thousand jobs created if the supplementary budget is passed quickly. If it isn't passed, we are missing the chance to add these jobs.""
The government will reveal a set of strategies this month,... that could help revive the manufacturing industry.
It will also sequentially announce plans for each industry's innovative growth,... beginning with future cars in August.

On Tuesday factory orders for April declined .8% compared to the prior month‚Äôs 1.3% gain.

Democrats in both the House and Senate are working on legislation called The Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act, which would remove the barriers that are currently in place and therefore allow shooting victims to sue gun manufacturers. Right now, gun makers have immunity from lawsuits, but that could change if this legislation is successful. Ring of Fire‚Äôs Farron Cousins discusses this.

Democrats in both the House and the Senate have put forward legislation that would actually repeal rules that are currently in place and have been in place since 2005 that give immunity to gun makers, gun manufacturers, gun sellers, ammunition wholesalers, all the people involved in the gun industry. Basically right now they have immunity from being sued by the victims and their families of shootings here in the United States. While House and Senate Democrats have come up with a piece of legislation called the equal access to justice for victims of gun violence act, that would basically take those protections and immunity away from the gun industry and say, Nope, you are now open for business in terms of being sued when your products are involved in a fatality, in an atrocity, whatever it is, your putting this product on the market, this product is killing people. You should be able to be sued for that.
Here's the thing, you have gun rights activists out there right now. Lawrence King of the National Shooting Sports Foundation who came out and said the following in response, he said, you would know more charge or blame Ford or General Motors for drunk driving accidents. Basically saying like, yeah, people drive drunk. It's not the fault of the would automobile maker. Just like, oh, people get shot. It's not the fault of the gun maker. You have a valid point, but let me go ahead and expand upon that. Suppose Ford or GM was out, their marketing, their tool as, hey, these vehicles are so easy to drive that even a drunk could do it. Or maybe they sponsor an event where they're just given out free alcohol all day while selling vehicles. Then yes, suddenly the liability shifts a little bit, doesn't it? And that's what these gone lawsuits would be about. Not just the fact that, oh, somebody went out and shot somebody.
Let's sue the gun maker. It's not gonna work like that because yes, that would be a huge issue. You can't just sue somebody for their thing being involved in a bad thing. However, if the marketing of these guns, ammunition, whatever it is, is marketed in a way that glorifies any kind of violence in any way. And it could just be talking about how fast it can get bullets out of the barrel that could make them liable. If gun sellers in this country aren't doing their due diligence, if they're not performing the background checks, if they're selling guns to people who they know shouldn't have them, that is a new avenue of liability under this particular act. Now, the sad part here is that obviously the Democrats support it, which is great. Republicans will not, this not going to pass the Senate, and then even if it did, you're definitely not going to get Donald Trump to sign it in a law.

This plan shows why primaries are important, and it shows just how little we‚Äôre getting from a majority of the other Democratic candidates. Ring of Fire‚Äôs Farron Cousins discusses this.

Yeah, I might be showing my age a little bit here, but I remember when the iPhone first came out. Uh, you know, first couple of years of it. Really all the commercials would be, there's an app for that. Oh, I want to do with that. There's an app for that. I, we all remembered there's an app for that. We need to amend that phrase and the phrase needs to be amended to say, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that because that is what Elizabeth Warren's campaign for president has been about from day one. Oh, she's identified a problem over here. I wonder how, Oh, crap. While she already has a plan for that, holy crap. That was fast. It's like that with every single issue. Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that, and I love it because that is what a Democratic primary hell, any primary, really, that's what the primary supposed to be about.
Right? The Battle of ideas. But if you don't give us any plans, you're really not participating in the battle of ideals. And you're over here in the battle of bell vague platitudes, which is where too many Democratic presidential candidates are. You got Beto, Biden, Buttigieg. All of them are over here fighting for platitudes while people like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, they're actually over here talking about ideas. But this week Elizabeth Warren came out with what may be her most ambitious and best plan to date, and it is her $2 trillion plan to save the planet and help boost theU s economy. Like it's never been boosted before. Now, before I get into the specifics of her plan, let me go ahead and say something about what this plan does. She wants the $2 trillion investment over 10 years and part of it's going to be for manufacturing green technology for the US to export all over the planet.
That is going to be a $26 trillion industry according to analysts. So we invest 2 trillion, but we could take at least half of that $26 trillion if not more, a market that's about to open up. So we would make a huge profit off of that. But the reason I like this, and again, not even getting into the specifics yet, but the reason this is such a good idea is because she's finally tying, or a politician, I want to say her. She's finally doing it. Politicians are finally tying climate change to the economy. Now, believe it or not, folks, back in 2015, Hillary Clinton tried to do the same thing. My name was on, uh, October of 2015. I remember I did a lot of stories on it at the time cause I loved the plan. She came up with a $30 billion plan to take coal miners and coal mining states, retrain them to work in a green technology field. You know, get 'em out of the coal mines. Instead, we're going to have you building solar panels, cleaner, better work. I think it was only two months. Two months later she came back out and said, yeah, you know what? I don't even like my own plan. I'm not gonna do that anymore. And that was one of the big things that really soured me on Hillary Clinton. I don't think we'd be looking at the same thing with Elizabeth Warren here. She understands that, guess what folks we're running out of time. We are running at a time and other horrible new report came out this week saying that entire civilizations could, could potentially start collapsing by 2050 we are out of time.

2204,n0buXS5N3E,"Trump Slams 'Loser, Dummy' Joe Biden Ahead of Competing Iowa Events","President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are assailing each other in overlapping visits to the key state of Iowa on Tuesday, previewing what the country might get in next year‚Äôs election if Biden becomes his party‚Äôs nominee.

The president unleashed a series of schoolyard taunts of the former vice president before taking off from the White House, declaring ‚ÄúJoe Biden is a dummy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather run against Biden than anybody,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs the weakest mentally and I like running against people that are weak mentally.‚Äù

Biden, too, was going on the offense, campaigning alone in Iowa in an effort to present himself as the front-runner in a field of two dozen Democrats. He released an advance text of his speech in which he slams Trump, essentially goading the president to respond to him directly.

In it, he calls Trump an ‚Äúexistential threat to America.‚Äù That was part of his effort to emphasize the economy‚Äî an issue the president often promotes as his chief strength in a time of low unemployment ‚Äî during a speech in Davenport, a center of eastern Iowa‚Äôs agricultural manufacturing industry.

‚ÄúHow many sleepless nights do you think Trump has had over what he‚Äôs doing to America‚Äôs farmers?‚Äù Biden will ask, according to the prepared remarks. ‚ÄúZero.‚Äù

Though the race for the Democratic nomination is early and fluid, the dueling visits to Iowa offer a glimpse into what a Trump-Biden matchup might portend. Trump and Biden have been circling each other for months .

Despite the private counsel of his advisers, Trump had thrown a steady stream of public insults at Biden even before his fresh round Tuesday. Since March, Trump has mocked or criticized Biden on Twitter nearly 40 times.

In one of his most brazen attacks, during a recent state visit to Japan , Trump echoed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un‚Äôs description of Biden as ‚Äúlow-IQ.‚Äù

Biden, in turn, has hit at Trump. At a recent Houston fundraiser, Biden vowed not to ‚Äúget down in the mud wrestling with this fella,‚Äù only to say later at the same event, ‚ÄúWe all know this guy doesn‚Äôt know anything.‚Äù

Both men have something to prove during this trip.

2209,TMzKAU8fpi,These are CRAZY GOOD lenses: Sony 600mm f/4 & 200-600mm f/5.6-6.3,"Read our full report on the Sony FE 200-600mm f/5.6-6.3 G: https://www.imaging-resource.com/lens...

Read our full report on the Sony FE 600mm f/4 GM OSS: 

What's special about the Sony 200-600mm? Well, when it comes to versatility, it's hard to argue with the appeal of a zoom lens. It's perhaps especially so when you get into the realm of supertelephoto lenses, which are often big, heavy, and usually very expensive. So, for photographers wanting to capture sports, wildlife, birds and other far-off subject matter, having a single lens that can ""do it all"" is an appealing concept.

In the Sony camp, they already offer a classic 100-400mm full-frame zoom, which is already quite a versatile, high-quality zoom, but for those who want or need more reach, the new FE 200-600mm f/5.6-6.3 G OSS zoom lens is a very tempting option.

Although the full-frame Sony Alpha system has been around for a few years now, it's still a fairly new system in the grand scheme of things compared to other full-frame camera manufacturers. As such, Sony has been steadily filling out its FE-mount lens lineup over the years, and now offers an extremely versatile range of lenses across the focal length spectrum.

However, one of Sony's more recent areas of focus has been to address its lack of pro-grade supertelephoto lenses. Last year, Sony introduced their first such lens, the FE 400mm f/2.8 GM OSS. A classic, sports-centric telephoto prime, the FE 400mm f/2.8 lens is a must-have for serious and professional sports photographers. Sony has now followed up its 400mm pro prime with yet another supertelephoto offering, the FE 600mm f/4 GM OSS. Much like its 400mm f/2.8 GM sibling, the FE 600mm f/4 lens utilizes a very similar design and construction, making it extremely lightweight, balanced and shockingly easy to use handheld. And, according to Sony, this particular lens has been the most requested lens from professional photographers. Much like a 400mm f/2.8 lens, a 600mm f/4 is another must-have lens for any camera and lens manufacturer catering to professional photographers.

2210,qDySL4k1U,BMW Concept R18 VS BMW Old R32 - Motorcycle Evolution 1953 - 2020,"Comparison between BMW R18 Concept and BMW R32

BMW Motorbike Design & Technique Evolution from 1923 to 2020.

The BMW Motorrad Concept R18 shows how the upgrade of a boxer engine from the 1960s can, today, be minimalist in a custom motorcycle combined with all the icons of classic BMW Motorrad design. ""With an evident minimalist aesthetic, the Concept R18 embodies, in my opinion, the essence of motorcycling. It is about feeling instead of thinking, not using technology for a mere representation of the same but giving space to the imagination. 
""This concept bike draws a deep instinct: it just feels like getting in the saddle and starting off"" explains Edgar Heinrich, Head of Design at BMW Motorrad.

The BMW R32 was the first motorcycle produced by BMW under the BMW name. An aircraft engine manufacturer during World War I, BMW was forced to diversify after the Treaty of Versailles banned the German air force and German aircraft manufacture. BMW initially turned to industrial engine design and manufacturing. The R32 established the boxer-twin, shaft-drive powertrain layout that BMW would use until the present. BMW used shaft drives in all of its motorcycles until the introduction of the F650 in 1994 and continues to use it on their boxer-twin motorcycles.

So far, Republicans and Democrats in the US Senate have been trying to put forth bills this year to basically increase cybersecurity for our elections. They want to put new regulations on voting machines. You know, the entire industry that currently really has no actual regulations on it. They want to make sure that we can audit our elections to make sure nobody's gone in there hacked. It changed results that voting machines aren't changing people's votes after they leave because they're not giving them a paper receipt. Yeah. Democrats and Republicans agree, Hey, we need to do this. Especially because Robert Mueller told us that our election systems were hacked. They did get into these. We don't think they changed any vote totals, but they took a hell of a lot of information or at least had access to it. Not to mention the fact that about a year ago we found out that even 11 year old children were capable of hacking into these systems.
So for the love of God, could we please do something about it? We've got all these pieces of legislation, Democrats and Republicans support it. So what's the hold up? The hold up is one man, one man by the name of Mitch Mcconnell, the Senate majority leader for the Republican Party. Mitch Mcconnell is refusing to allow any of these bipartisan pieces of legislation to even come to a vote on the Senate floor. And for a very long time I had assumed obviously that it was because every time there seems to be something screwy with a voting system, it always seems to help the Republican Party. And Mitch Mcconnell doesn't want to make any waves. He doesn't want to screw things up for his Republican brethren. So why would he bring, uh, bring these things to a vote when he knows it's ultimately going to cost them votes? Well, it turns out the good folks over at sludge, specifically Donald Shaw, did a little more digging into this more than just my speculation and Donald Shaw found out another very good reason why Mitch Mcconnell is blocking these votes to put tighter regulations on voting machine companies.
As it turns out, voting machine companies, specifically esns and dominion voting systems who provide 80% of the voting machines in this country, they've actually ramped up their lobbying efforts as industries that are in trouble, typically do. And in addition to hiring all these extra lobbyists to go out there and just wine and dine and Schmooze with these politicians, they're same. Lobbyists have also started donating money to Mitch Mcconnell's reelection campaign. You know, we're not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's, you know, on the smaller side is Shaul points out in the piece a thousand here, a thousand there, 2000 over here, maybe another two, one, two, whatever it is. But for a guy like Mitch Mcconnell, that's all it takes. He's a pretty cheap date, right? You don't have to pay $100,000 to buy off his vote, especially when it's for something that you know is going to benefit the Republican party anyway.

2219,HcuVRw7MzLM,Joe Biden Promises to Cure Cancer If Elected While Campaigning in Iowa,"President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are assailing each other in overlapping visits to the key state of Iowa on Tuesday, previewing what the country might get in next year‚Äôs election if Biden becomes his party‚Äôs nominee.

The president unleashed a series of schoolyard taunts of the former vice president before taking off from the White House, declaring ‚ÄúJoe Biden is a dummy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather run against Biden than anybody,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs the weakest mentally and I like running against people that are weak mentally.‚Äù

Biden, too, was going on the offense, campaigning alone in Iowa in an effort to present himself as the front-runner in a field of two dozen Democrats. He released an advance text of his speech in which he slams Trump, essentially goading the president to respond to him directly.

In it, he calls Trump an ‚Äúexistential threat to America.‚Äù That was part of his effort to emphasize the economy‚Äî an issue the president often promotes as his chief strength in a time of low unemployment ‚Äî during a speech in Davenport, a center of eastern Iowa‚Äôs agricultural manufacturing industry.

‚ÄúHow many sleepless nights do you think Trump has had over what he‚Äôs doing to America‚Äôs farmers?‚Äù Biden will ask, according to the prepared remarks. ‚ÄúZero.‚Äù

Though the race for the Democratic nomination is early and fluid, the dueling visits to Iowa offer a glimpse into what a Trump-Biden matchup might portend. Trump and Biden have been circling each other for months .

Despite the private counsel of his advisers, Trump had thrown a steady stream of public insults at Biden even before his fresh round Tuesday. Since March, Trump has mocked or criticized Biden on Twitter nearly 40 times.

In one of his most brazen attacks, during a recent state visit to Japan , Trump echoed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un‚Äôs description of Biden as ‚Äúlow-IQ.‚Äù

Biden, in turn, has hit at Trump. At a recent Houston fundraiser, Biden vowed not to ‚Äúget down in the mud wrestling with this fella,‚Äù only to say later at the same event, ‚ÄúWe all know this guy doesn‚Äôt know anything.‚Äù

Both men have something to prove during this trip.

For Trump, the biggest concern in this state dominated by agriculture interests is trade. He begins his trip in Council Bluffs to tour and speak at Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, which produces and sells the corn-based fuel additive ethanol, before addressing an Iowa GOP dinner in Des Moines.

He‚Äôs expected to highlight his efforts to help farmers hurt financially from Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture products, measures that were imposed last year after Trump slapped levies on Chinese imports.

The 2019 Ford EcoSport Thunder Edition is priced at ‚Çπ 10.18 lakh for the petrol model and ‚Çπ 10.68 lakh (all prices, ex-showroom) for the diesel version. The recently launched Hyundai Venue is off to a blockbuster start and that has pushed a lot of manufacturers to rejig their product range to remain competitive. The new Thunder Edition arrives just days after Maruti Suzuki introduced the Vitara Brezza Sports Edition in the market. In addition, the automaker has revised the 2019 EcoSport range by adding and deleting features across different variants.

The 2019 Ford EcoSport Thunder Edition brings a host of cosmetic add-ons including the dark inserts on the headlamp cluster and prominent black treatment to the fog lamp bezel. The black theme is carried over to the grille, roof, rear view mirrors and the dual-tone bonnet with the sides getting black decals on the doors and black finished 17-inch alloy wheels. The cabin also gets the sporty dark theme and comes with a dual-tone dashboard, door panels and seats finished in cognac accents. The limited Thunder edition also gets an electric sunroof, while the 9-inch floating touchscreen infotainment system gets SYNC 3, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto along with embedded navigation.

The new Ford EcoSport Thunder Edition will be available as an option pack on the Titanium variant. Power on the limited edition comes from the same 1.5-litre three-cylinder TiVCT petrol that churns out 121 bhp while returning 17 kmpl, while there's also the tried and tested 1.5-litre diesel with 99 bhp returning a claimed 23 kmpl.

Outwardly, the plane may look heavy and strange in a way. Engineers found a way for the aircraft to carry additional fuel in two conformal tanks with a total capacity of 2,020 liters. The additional fuel tanks make the plane look humpbacked. At the same time, the range of the fighter was increased 3,5 times.

The MiG-29CMT was outfitted with a removable refueling bar for air refueling operations. The bar can be either installed or removed in field conditions within a maximum of two hours.

The cockpit of the fighter jet was reworked entirely. The information and control field of the cockpit of the MiG-29CMT includes two new large-format multifunctional indicators. Now the pilot can perform combat missions without taking his hands off the thrusters.

Opportunities for using high-precision air-to-surface weapons were significantly expanded.

Often it is equipped with special wheels to allow it to travel on tracks, or equipped to participate in parades or car races; the Monster Truck version is famous.

The latest version of the Chevrolet Silverado
The latest evolution of the Chevrolet Silverado appeared on the market in 2013, but it is already possible to find some of the used cars.

2241,zM_2i0AvbeM,Production Function In Hindi / ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§® ‡§´‡§≤‡§® ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à?,"Production Function: 
In simple words, production function refers to the functional relationship between the quantity of a good produced (output) and factors of production (inputs)

Production is the result of co-operation of factors of production viz., land, labour, capital, technology and organization etc.
Q = f( L, K,T,A,B,.......Z )
Where Q = Quantity of output
L = Labor
K= Capital 
T= Technology 
A = Land.
Hence, the level of output (Q), depends on the quantities of different inputs (L, K, A) available to the firm. In the simplest case, where there are only two inputs, labour (L) and capital (K) and one output (Q), the production function becomes.
Q =f (L, K)
‚ÄúProduction function is the relationship between inputs of productive services per unit of time and outputs of product per unit of time.‚Äù Prof. George J. Stigler

Defined production function as ‚Äúthe relation between a firm‚Äôs physical production (output) and the material factors of production (inputs).‚Äù Prof. Watson

‚ÄúThe production function is purely a technical relation which connects factor inputs and output.‚Äù Prof. Koutsoyiannis",Manufacturing

The program is led by Jon Skow who has over 30 years experience teaching industrial arts at PHS.

Darrin Swanson, CEO of KitMasters, led the effort to establish this program in Perham after hearing about a similar program called Cardinal Manufacturing in Eleva Strum, Wisconsin.  He organized a group of school administrators and local business leaders to travel to Wisconsin, tour their facility and learn about the positive impact it was having on students.  Armed with this information, plans were made to incorporate a student run manufacturing business in the new high school building.  Jacket Manufacturing partners with local businesses including KitMasters, KLN Enterprises, Lund Boats, BTD Manufacturing, and Bongards Creamery who donate equipment, time and expertise to the students. 

So far, this program has been a smashing success.  In 2018-2019, the first year of operations, Jacket Manufacturing successfully completed $17,000 of projects.  More importantly, it provided new learning opportunities and a practical education to our students, and the buy-in has been tremendous.",Manufacturing

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",History

2261,zKLH-N_X5j4,The Worst Punishments For Women In History That You Can't Believe,"‚ùÄ ‚ô° ‚ô™    Instead of punishing with death, ancient and modern nations have created many forms of cruel torture exclusively for women ...
10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

Once upon a time, or to be more accurate, around 70,000 years ago people in Africa decided that they got tired of living with angry hungry neighbors aka hungry animals. They left the continent and reached India. It was a long hard way. The scientists will later call it the coastal migration. Yep, they have a word for everything. 

They didn‚Äôt stand idly by. They beginning to learn the surroundings and by 6,500 BC began farming. They also raised cattle, goats, and sheep. Water buffalo were used to pull carts. Guys, now that we have food, let‚Äôs created something to store it in. By 5,500 BC they intended and widely used pottery. Well done people.

Lyrics

I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you‚Äôre sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn‚Äôt do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can‚Äôt even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you‚Äôre sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn‚Äôt do
baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can‚Äôt even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
(Oh, yeah)
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn‚Äôt do
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can‚Äôt even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about

Lyrics

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broken inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

‚ÄúAn affair is a love ‚Äì or physical ‚Äì story between two people, one of whom (at least) is ostensibly committed to someone else. Most importantly, in our times, an affair is a catastrophe, pretty much the greatest betrayal that can befall us, a harbinger of untrammelled suffering, frequently the end of the marriage it has violated and almost always an occasion for fierce moralising and the division of participants into goodies (who have been betrayed) and monsters (who have betrayed).‚Äù

2274,N7VQas4OgQ,The History of Earth - Full Documentary HD,"n the very beginning of earth's history, this planet was a giant, red hot, roiling, boiling sea of molten rock - a magma ocean. The heat had been generated by the repeated high speed collisions of much smaller bodies of space rocks that continually clumped together as they collided to form this planet. As the collisions tapered off the earth began to cool, forming a thin crust on its surface. As the cooling continued, water vapor began to escape and condense in the earth's early atmosphere. Clouds formed and storms raged, raining more and more water down on the primitive earth, cooling the surface further until it was flooded with water, forming the seas.

It is theorized that the true age of the earth is about 4.6 billion years old, formed at about the same time as the rest of our solar system. The oldest rocks geologists have been able to find are 3.9 billion years old. Using radiometric dating methods to determine the age of rocks means scientists have to rely on when the rock was initially formed (as in - when its internal minerals first cooled). In the infancy of our home planet the entire earth was molten rock - a magma ocean.

Since we can only measure as far back in time as we had solid rock on this planet, we are limited in how we can measure the real age of the earth. Due to the forces of plate tectonics, our planet is also a very dynamic one; new mountains forming, old ones wearing down, volcanoes melting and reshaping new crust. The continual changing and reshaping of the earth's surface that involves the melting down and reconstructing of old rock has pretty much eliminated most of the original rocks that came with earth when it was newly formed. So the age is a theoretical age.

When Did Life on Earth Begin?

Scientists are still trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of earth: When did ""life"" first appear and how did it happen? It is estimated that the first life forms on earth were primitive, one-celled creatures that appeared about 3 billion years ago. That's pretty much all there was for about the next two billion years. Then suddenly those single celled organisms began to evolve into multicellular organisms. Then an unprecedented profusion of life in incredibly complex forms began to fill the oceans. Some crawled from the seas and took residence on land, perhaps to escape predators in the ocean. A cascading chain of new and increasingly differentiated forms of life appeared all over the planet, only to be virtually annihilated by an unexplained mass extinction. It would be the first of several mass extinctions in Earth's history.

Scientists have been looking increasingly to space to explain these mass extinctions that have been happening almost like clockwork since the beginning of ""living"" time. Perhaps we've been getting periodically belted by more space rocks (ie. asteroids), or the collision of neutron stars happening too close for comfort? Each time a mass extinction occurred, life found a way to come back from the brink. Life has tenaciously clung to this small blue planet for the last three billion years. Scientists are finding new cues as to how life first began on earth in some really interesting places - the deep ocean.",History

Proponents of this theory believe that these civilizations were wiped off the planet and that the evidence now lies buried miles beneath the Earth's surface. This two-hour special will investigate these beliefs and uncover the truth about people who lived before the beginning of recorded time.

2285,DoIQdQ9Mo5E,Lady Jane Grey (England's Forgotten Queen) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Lady Jane Grey became a Tudor Queen after the dying King Edward VI, the only son of Henry VIII left her the throne. Now, historian Helen Castor explores the tragic story of Lady Jane Grey and investigates how her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, was sealed as soon as she was drawn into the line of succession. 

In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.

This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.

The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.
Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.

Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.

Today, we use a shotgun in every single Call of Duty game ever made!

‚Ä¶except for the first COD game, Big Red One, Call of Duty Online, and Call of Duty Mobile‚Ä¶

lol

I decided to do a challenge video AGAIN; play every Call of Duty game ever made in one video, and try to get as many kills in Team Deathmatch in 1 minute, but this time with Shotguns!

This video includes gameplay and some of my opinions about Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Call of Duty 4, Call of Duty: World at War, Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 2, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3, Modern Warfare Remastered, Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty WW2, and Black Ops 4! That‚Äôs 15 Call of Duty games in ONE video‚Ä¶WOW

All of this footage was captured on the Xbox One at 1080p 60fps and on the PS4 at 1080p 60fps so you can see all of the graphic and gameplay changes over time!

The shotguns of Call of Duty have changed a lot over time; from the classic M1897 Trench Gun to the Brecci, COD shotguns went from 0 to 100 real quick!

As usual, I‚Äôm really surprised with the results of this challenge video as well‚Ä¶

So, what do YOU think is the best shotgun in Call of Duty of ALL TIME? Which COD game do you think has the most fun to use shotguns? Leave a comment letting me know! :D

In this first programme of two, Simon and Kate explore why wildfires in Australia are so frequent and hard to control, unlocking the surprising secrets of fire behaviour with leading scientists working to help those on the frontline.

There‚Äôs a great story to this video and it mostly starts with you.  We did a spin-off video called Flash In the Pan Hip-hop Conflicts of Nowadays featuring Ronald McDonald vs The Burger King.  You dug it but the verdict was clear that there should have been a Wendy‚Äôs cameo and that we should make the matchup a video for the main channel.  We also left out a few clutch disses in the lyrics (ahem) foot lettuce...and you helped us plug those holes.  So dope.

2315,xy_M4pDjaf,Catholic Counter-Reformation: Crash Course European History #9,"When the Protestant Reformation broke out in Western Europe, the Catholic Church got the message, at least a little bit. Pope Paul III called a council to look into reforming some aspects of the Catholic Church and try to stem the tide of competing Christian sects popping up all over the place. The Council of Trent changed some aspects of the organization, but doubled down on a lot  of the practices that Martin Luther and other reformers had a problem with. Today you'll learn about the Council of Trent, the rise of the Jesuits, and Saint Teresa of Avila.

2320,DLk67oMq8Og,Old Fashioned Cocktail History & Evolution | How to Drink,"A longer look at the Old-Fashioned and how to make it 5 different ways, covering its evolution from 1850-2019.  That's right: FIVE DRINKS.

**********************************

Very first Episode of HTD: 
You can Pre-Order Mid-Century Cocktail here:


This week on How to Drink I'm doing a deep dive into the Old Fashioned tracing it's evolution from the room-temperature ""Cocktail"" of the 1850's all the way up to today's spirit forward speakeasy friendly drink in 2019.  I make five drinks along the way, and truth be told there's probably a lot more I could have done with this drink (the cocktail ""schism"" that coined the name ""Old-Fashioned"" was tied to reconstruction era politics and that's a whole lot to unpack) but this episode was already twenty minutes long so I figured we save that for another day.

The 1850's Cocktail
1 sugar cube Soak with bitters
~ 2oz. -or- 60 ml. of spirit (I go with Genever here)
~ 3oz. -or- 90 ml. of Water (could be less)
Stir till sugar dissolves
Garnish with grated nutmeg (or the twist of your choice)

1860's Improved Whiskey Cocktail
2 bar-spoons of Gum Syrup
1 dash of Cura√ßao
1 Dash of Maraschino
1-2 dashes of Absinthe
2-4 Dashes Angostura Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Rye
Garnish with Flamed Orange Twist

1870's Old-Fashioned Cocktail
Sugar Cube soaked in Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Rye
Stir over ice
Garnish with Twist of Lemon or Orange

The Mid-Century Old-Fashioned
1 wedge of Orange
2 Maraschino Cherries
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
2 Dashes Angostura Bitters
Muddle fruit and drink together
bury in cracked ice and stir

The Modern Old-Fashioned

Two Dashes Angostura Bitters
2 oz. -or- 60 ml. Bourbon
Stir over big ice

When it comes to the length of wrestling matches, there‚Äôs rarely a limit. Once in a while a cap is placed on the amount of time allowed, and obviously televised matches need to fit within a designated timeslot, but most of the time, wrestlers are able to continue grappling until someone is pinned and a winner is declared.

However, on the other end of the spectrum, the shortest amount of time possible for a wrestling match is three seconds - just enough time for the referee to count off the pin. Through distractions, quickly gained advantages, and devastating finishers, a couple matches have actually lasted for only the minimum length, with a number of other notable bouts coming quite close. Here are the 10 shortest matches in WWE history.

Featuring an interview with former military intelligence official and Special Agent In- Charge, Luis Elizondo, who confirmed the existence of the hidden government program, the controversial story was the focus of worldwide attention. Previously run by Elizondo, AATIP was created to research and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) including numerous videos of reported encounters, three of which were released to a shocked public in 2017. Elizondo resigned after expressing to the government that these UAPs could pose a major threat to our national security and not enough was being done to combat them or address our potential vulnerabilities. Now, as a part of HISTORY‚Äôs groundbreaking new six-part, one-hour limited series ‚ÄúUnidentified: Inside America‚Äôs UFO Investigation‚Ñ¢,‚Äù Elizondo is speaking out for the first time with Tom DeLonge, co-founder and President of To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science and Chris Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and Intelligence, to expose a series of startling encounters and embark on fascinating new investigations that will urge the public to ask questions and look for answers.

Human evolution is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of anatomically modern humans, beginning with the evolutionary history of primates ‚Äì in particular genus Homo ‚Äì and leading to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language.[1]

The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, paleontology, neurobiology, ethology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and genetics.[2] Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about 85 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene, around 55 million years ago.[3]

Within the Hominoidea (apes) superfamily, the Hominidae family diverged from the Hylobatidae (gibbon) family some 15‚Äì20 million years ago; African great apes (subfamily Homininae) diverged from orangutans (Ponginae) about 14 million years ago; the Hominini tribe (humans, Australopithecines and other extinct biped genera, and chimpanzee) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between 9 million years ago and 8 million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes Hominina (humans and biped ancestors) and Panina (chimps) separated about 7.5 million years ago to 5.6 million years ago.
Human evolution from its first separation from the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes. The most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism, increased brain size, lengthened ontogeny (gestation and infancy), and decreased sexual dimorphism. The relationship between these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[5][page needed] Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus.
Bipedalism
Bipedalism is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either Sahelanthropus[7] or Orrorin, both of which arose some 6 to 7 million years ago. The non-bipedal knuckle-walkers, the gorilla and chimpanzee, diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same time, so either of Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor. Ardipithecus, a full biped, arose somewhat later.
The early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still later into the genus Homo. There are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion,[8] enabled long distance running and hunting, provided an enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the East African Rift Valley uplift versus the previous closed forest habitat.[9][8][10] A new study provides support for the hypothesis that walking on two legs, or bipedalism, evolved because it used less energy than quadrupedal knuckle-walking.[11][12] However, recent studies suggest that bipedality without the ability to use fire would not have allowed global dispersal.[13] This change in gait saw a lengthening of the legs proportionately when compared to the length of the arms, which were shortened through the removal of the need for brachiation. Another change is the shape of the big toe.

Knockout is a spectacular ending to a boxing match. The competitor takes a blow, after which he is unable to continue the fight before the judge will count from 1 to 10.  The referee sees that the boxer was knocked out when he‚Äôs being disoriented or even goes unconscious. This means that the athlete lost the fight. The ability to knock someone out depends on the accuracy of the strike, the element of surprise, correct distribution of body weight, right technic and other factors. In this episode, I will show you the fastest knockouts in the world that are forever inscribed in the history of boxing.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and went on to become one of the most influential, innovative, and successful groups in modern music, having sold more than 300 million albums worldwide. The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when Jimmy Page brought in John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant to tour as The New Yardbirds. In 1969, Led Zeppelin released its self-titled debut which was produced by Page, as were all the subsequent albums. It marked the beginning of a 12-year reign, during which the group was widely considered to be the biggest and most innovative rock band in the world.

2353,iloQeu-Yg7U,The Biggest Lies Told in History,"From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  

Subscribe to American Eye 

10. Columbus Discovered America

9. Paul Revere

8. 13 Colonies

7. Washington Cherry Tree

6. The Crossing of the Delaware

5. Van Gogh Cut off Ear
While in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 

4. Sphinx Nose
How did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 

3. Vikings Horned Helmets
Archaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies

2. Stonehenge
One of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 

1. First Thanksgiving
Sorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",History

You'll learn about Franz Ferdinand, Gavrilo Pincep, the Black Hand, and why the Serbian nationalists wanted to kill the poor Archduke. You'll also learn who mobilized first and who exactly started the war. Sort of. Actually there's no good answer to who started the war, but we give it a shot anyway.

At Khartoum, the White Nile is joined by the Blue Nile which flows from the southeast and Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Once a great trading center, Khartoum still has many remnants of the 19th century battles with the British. Lumley also undergoes a special skin treatment using scented acacia wood. On leaving Khartoum, she flies to Lake Tana where she eats some of the local delicacies and enjoys a local alcoholic beverage. A visit to St. George's monastery reveals extraordinary murals. From Lake Tana they drive to the Simien Mountains where young women train as long distance runners.

2361,xuaYPff-14,Mind-altering drugs: The magical history of LSD and mushrooms | Michael Pollan,"Why did government officials stop psychedelics from reaching mainstream culture?

- In the '60s drugs escape the lab and become a very important ingredient In the creation of the counterculture. Timothy Leary, a psychologist at Harvard in 1960, has something to do with this.

- In Cambridge, he starts the Harvard Psilocybin Project which focuses its research into learning more about this promising drug. Because of its medicinal properties, and apparent positive effect on mental health, Leary believed that everyone should use acid, or psilocybin.

- Richard Nixon called Leary the most dangerous man in America. He felt that LSD and other drugs were sapping the will of American boys to fight in Vietnam.

For the past twenty-five years, Michael Pollan has been writing books and articles about the places where nature and culture intersect: on our plates, in our farms and gardens, and in the built environment. His latest is How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence - 

He is the author four New York Times bestsellers: Food Rules: An Eater‚Äôs Manual (2010); In Defense of Food: An Eater‚Äôs Manifesto (2008); The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals (2006) and The Botany of Desire: A Plant‚Äôs-Eye View of the World (2001). The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma was named one of the ten best books of 2006 by both the New York Times and the Washington Post. It also won the California Book Award, the Northern California Book Award, the James Beard Award, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. A young readers edition called The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma: the Secrets Behind What You Eat was published in 2009. The Botany of Desire received the Borders Original Voices Award for the best non-fiction work of 2001, and was recognized as a best book of the year by the American Booksellers Association and Amazon.com. PBS premiered a two-hour special documentary based on The Botany of Desire in fall 2009.

2367,Fk1XqrljVyI,Tiki Barber beefed so much with the Giants that everyone forgot how great he was,"Make sure you subscribe to SB Nation and don't forget to hit the bell so you never miss an episode of Beef History. If you actually want to relive the Super Bowl that I tried to kindly not remind you of, check out our episode of the Worst about it here: 

Tiki Barber ran the ball. The Giants liked that! Tiki Barber ran his mouth. The Giants didn't like that. While he statistically is the greatest running back in franchise history, the New York Giants and Tiki Barber became two ships passing in the night - but like if one of those ships would occasionally talk trash about the other ship.

Without him, the Giants found the success that had eluded them while Barber was on the roster. And without them, Barber found ways to stay busy. He bashed Eli. He bashed Coughlin. And he made it so no one missed the running back who had retired in his prime.

2377,YyM7lQYLuUY,"[BL] Tang Yi (History 3 trapped) ~ ""I'D DIE FOR YOU. EASY TO SAY.""","To Chris and Jake if you ever come across this edit which is not going to happen anyway but just so you know I love you both so much. Ok! I'll stop with my one sided love proclamation. This is a little something for my favorite character on the show that is Tang Yi. I like all the characters but there is something about Tang Yi that I find very fascinating like you don't know what's doing on in that head under his calm demeanor. He has so many shades to him. TY's break down scene was so intense. It's good that at least he has Shao Fei there for him. They really complement each other. If a man takes a bullet for you, marry him lol. I lost count on how many times Shao Fei risked his life for him. He doesn't think, does he? So impulsive!

Zhao Zi reminds me of Panda. He eats, ok, more like glutton. He sleeps like no one's watching and he's cute. And my goodness how much Jack spoils and pampers him. I wouldn't mind watching a drama special or movie for these two because they have inadequate screen time. Thank for bringing an entertaining BL series to us all, something different from the school, college romances and the usual stories. I wish the franchise to get bigger and better each year.

I don't know what came over me that I chose such a difficult song to edit. Honestly mid way the thought of abandoning this edit and doing it on some other song has crossed my mind. But I somehow ended up completing it.

Note: The exact identity of the human species found at Happisburgh is a little more up in the air than this video makes it sound. Currently academic consensus looks to be moving towards Homo antecessor as the correct identity, however the stone tools found at Pakefield and Boxgrove are almost certainly from Homo heidelbergensis. This was simplified to Homo heidelbergensis in the video for the sake of brevity. Homo heidelbergensis may also have been ambush predators on top of scavengers and fishers.

Lyrics

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broken inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Magneto. Here the two actors discuss their favorite scenes together, how each character has changed, what they drew from fellow actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, and whose side they would take if they lived in the X-Men universe.

So how did we get from a bitter beverage to the chocolate bars of today? Deanna Pucciarelli traces the fascinating and often cruel history of chocolate.

They then travel by car to Wawa where they boat down a stretch of Nile in search of giant crocodiles that can grow up to 20 feet long. A further trip by car takes them to a holy mountain and then go deep underground to visit the tomb of a Queen who lived circa 650 B.C.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War as it unfolded in Asia. As John pointed out last week, the Cold War was occasionally hot, and a lot of that heat was generated in Asia. This is starting to sound weird with the hot/cold thing, so let's just say that the United States struggle against communist expansion escalated to full-blown, boots on the ground war in Korea and Vietnam. In both of these cases, the United States sent soldiers to intervene in civil wars that it looked like communists might win. That's a bit of a simplification, but John will explain it all to you.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War, which was the decades long conflict between the USA and the USSR. The Cold War was called cold because of the lack of actual fighting, but this is inaccurate. There was plenty of fighting, from Korea to Viet Nam to Afghanistan, but we'll get into that stuff next week. This week we'll talk about how the Cold War started. In short it grew out of World War II. Basically, the Soviets occupied eastern Europe, and the US supported western Europe. This setup would spill across the world, with client states on both sides. It's all in the video. You should just watch it.

Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. The Cold War spanned over four decades of American history, beginning with the paranoia of McCarthyism, a political witch hunt for communists:

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",History

2435,QZxpU,The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel,"Back when the internet was young and facts still had meaning, there was the History Channel, featuring shows about - you guessed it - history. But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.
Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.
But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.
Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.

How evil must you be to use your position of power to oppress innocent people? Take Pope Alexander VI. This awful ‚Äúreligious‚Äù leader would use all sorts of schemes to rob people of their money rich and poor alike.  But that‚Äôs nothing compared to someone like Idi Amin who massacred around 300,000 civilians. Then there are those terrorist leaders like Osama Bin Laden who ordered the execution of 9/11 and ordered his own men to sacrifice themselves in order to kill innocent lives.

Braveheart is a 1995 historical drama epic film directed by and starring Mel Gibson. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The story is based on Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.

The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, and Best Director.

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.[26] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.""[26] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), [27] there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle).

Elizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which ""almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure"".[28] The ""brave heart"" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem Heart of Bruce, to Sir James the Good Douglas: ""Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!"", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[29] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[30]

Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period ""no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)."" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not ""in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film"". She compares the inaccuracy to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.""[31] ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate‚Äîin short, just about nothing is accurate.""[32] The belted plaid (feileadh m√≥r l√©ine) was not introduced until the 16th century.[33] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's ""farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."" [34]

In 2009, the film was second on a list of ""most historically inaccurate movies"" in The Times.[30] In the humorous non-fictional historiography An Utterly Impartial History of Britain (2007), author John O'Farrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a ""Plasticine dog"" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit.",History

Magic Weed : The Truth About Cannabis Sativa traces the story of the Cannabis plant, which has been known to mankind for thousands of years and how it serves us in so many ways. The sacred herb was always seen by Shamans and the ancients as a gift from the Creator God(s) of life on Earth. Like food nourishes the body, Cannabis provides nourishment for the mind and works it‚Äôs magic with the soul. Also explored in this documentary is the American relationship with hemp, including it‚Äôs ban during the 1920?s and the various uses of the hemp plant. 

Cannabis Sativa is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is a herb that has been used throughout recorded history by humans as a source of fiber, for its seed oil, as food, as medicine and for spiritual purposes. Different parts of the plant have different uses, and different varieties are cultivated in different ways and harvested at different times, depending on the purpose for which it is grown. Cannabis or Ganja is associated with Shiva, who is popularly believed to like the hemp plant.",History

I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended. Support CrashCourse on Patreon:

Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons ‚Äì there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, Neolithic farmers began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization. Today, the world produces roughly 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. Paul Kindstedt shares the history of one of our oldest and most beloved foods.

2484,kcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...

It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.

In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.

The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:
The American Adventure (1975)
American Adventures (1987)
American History (1982)
The American Pageant (1991)
The American Tradition (1984)
The American Way (1979)
The Challenge of Freedom (1990)
Discovering American History (1974)
Land of Promise (1983)
Life and Liberty (1984)
Triumph of the American Nation (1986)
The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)
In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:
The American Journey (2000)
The American Pageant (2006)
The Americans (2007)
America: Pathways to the Present (2005)
A History of the United States (2005)
Holt American Nation (2003)

Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.
Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.

Corrections:

1.  Beirut is in Lebanon, not Syria.

2.  At the time of the Roman Empire, Great Britain would have been known as Britannia rather than England.  The name ""England"" was first used during the Middle Ages, referring to the tribe of Germanic Angles that settled the island after the fall of the Roman Empire.

3.  Our Lady of Guadalupe is the only Marian apparition in the Americas to have been approved by the Holy See.  Other Marian apparitions in the Americas have been approved by local ordinaries, including Our Lady of Good Success in Ecuador (1572),  Our Lady of Good Help in Wisconsin (1859), Our Lady of Cuapa in Nicaragua (1980), in Venezuela (1984) and Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolas in Argentina (1980s).

4.  At , the correct spelling is ""Hugh O'Flaherty"", not ""O'Flattery""",History

JIMEK (Radzimir Dƒôbski), composer and producer.  JIMEK gained first international recognition when he was picked as the winner by Beyonc√© and judges such as Giorgio Moroder, Isabella 'the Machine' Summers, Afrojack in Beyonc√© 'End of Time' remix competition beating 3000 international contestants. The winning track was released on Beyonc√©'s next official release ""4: the Remix"".
He graduated with a degree in composition from the Chopin Music University in Warsaw and studied orchestration and film scoring at the University of California in Los Angeles. He started to work writing music for film and tv as a teenager, constantly building up his musical workshop and versatility, which led him to his love for stylistic liberty he calls 'smuggling'. Today his work ranges from writing and conducting contemporary symphonic pieces for philharmonics to producing completely electronic beats for collaborations and film.",History

2518,8w4Ku6l7OEI,Iran's Revolutions: Crash Course World History 226,"In which John Green teaches you about Iran's Revolutions. Yes, revolutions plural. What was the1979 Iranian Revolution about? It turns out, Iran has a pretty long history of unrest in order to put power in the hands of the people, and the most recent revolution in 1979 was, at least at first, not necessarily about creating an Islamic state. It certainly turned out to be about that, but it was initially just about people who wanted to get rid of an oppressive regime. Listen up as John teaches you about Iran's long history of revolution.

2522,1-JAx3nU,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclark

Check out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/

Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics:  

A few nitpicky things:
- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.
- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.
- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.
- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.

I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true... I was made for you

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you
Because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do and I was made for you

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π', which means 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he called Ivan 'the Terrible' in this video? Because he was evil or useless? No, it is because '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English many years ago as 'Terrible', when the word commonly meant awesome or formidable (see definitions 3 & 4 here: ). And in English, Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

In which John Green teaches you about a time of relative tumult in the United States, the 1960s. America was changing rapidly in the 1960s, and rights movements were at the forefront of those changes. Civil Rights were dominant, but the 60s also saw growth in the Women's Movement, the LGBT rights movement, the Latino rights movement, and the American Indian movement. Also, Americans began to pay a bit more attention to the environment. All this change happened against the backdrop of the Cold War and the Rise of Conservatism. It was just wild. John will teach you about sit-ins, Freedom Rides, The March on Washington, MLK, JFK, LBJ, and NOW. Man, that is a lot of initialisms. And one acronym.

The Civil Rights Movement reached a high point when Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his 1963 ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù Speech at the March on Washington: 
After President Kennedy's assassination, President Johnson decided to promote Civil Rights as part of his Great Society program:

Doch w√§hrend die einen Seite an Seite f√ºr ihre Ziele k√§mpfen, stolpern die anderen √ºber Eifers√ºchteleien oder ihre Streitsucht, werden zu erbitterten Feinden.

Dass ein Streit unter Geschwistern sogar lebensgef√§hrlich sein kann, haben die Tudor-Schwestern Elisabeth und Mary eindrucksvoll unter Beweis gestellt. Die katholische und ""blutige Mary"" lie√ü nicht nur jede Menge Protestanten hinrichten, sondern verfolgte auch ihre verhasste Halbschwester Elisabeth, den ""Bastard"" von K√∂nig Heinrich VIII. und Anne Boleyn. Elisabeth landete im Tower und konnte nur mit einem Trick dem Schafott entkommen. Wenige Jahre sp√§ter, nach dem fr√ºhen Tod Marys I. von England, bestieg sie selbst den Thron und regierte England lange und erfolgreich. 

Reinhold Messner hingegen verliert seinen j√ºngeren Bruder durch ein tragisches Ungl√ºck. Von einer gemeinsamen Expedition im Himalaya kommt nur einer der Extrembergsteiger lebend zur√ºck. Die genauen Umst√§nde des Todes von G√ºnther Messner sind bis heute nicht gekl√§rt. 

John F. und Robert, die ber√ºhmtesten Br√ºder des Kennedy-Clans, teilen nicht nur die Leidenschaft f√ºr die Politik, sondern auch ihr tragisches Schicksal: Beide sterben bei einem Mordanschlag.

Prior to the Protestant Reformation, pretty much everyone in Europe was a Roman Catholic. Not to get all great man, but Martin Luther changed all that. Martin Luther didn't like the corruption he saw in the  church, especially the sale of indulgences, so he left the church and started his own. And it caught on! And it really did kind of change the world. The changes increased literacy and education, and some even say the Protestant Reformation was the beginning of Capitalism in Europe.

While very few leaders were beheaded in the course of this one, it changed the lives of more people more dramatically than any of the political revolutions we've discussed. So, why did the Industrial Revolution happen around 1750 in the United Kingdom? Coal. Easily accessible coal, it turns out. All this, plus you'll finally learn the difference between James Watt and Thomas Newcomen, and will never again be caught telling people that your blender has a 900 Newcomen motor.

In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.

In this masterful talk, he explains how the great speakers in history use 7 secrets and how we can all become a great speaker by following these secrets and by not just giving a ""speech"" but rather creating ""conversations"" from the heart.

Richard has dedicated himself to creating new paradigms in Public Speaking, Politics, and even our understanding of God

Called ""The Master of Charisma"" by The Sunday Times, Richard quit his law practice to coach Presidents, Prime Ministers, Senators, Governors, CEOs, Royalty and celebrities in 44 countries. Chief Judge on TLC's ""The Messengers"", Author, ""Words That Shook The World: 100 Years of Unforgettable Speeches and Events"".

Richard Studied Political Science in The US and UK, ran for Congress in 1992, advises countless political leaders, hosted ""Hollywood CLOUT"", a live ""Hollywood Meets Politics"" talk show on Air America Radio for 3 years, blogs for The Huffington Post, created the non-partisan, celebrity driven ""Choose YOUR America"" campaign and ""The 2014 Midterm Election 'Answer-Thon'"" to increase political engagement in America.


About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",History

2600,SqDTJogdWmA,A Vanishing History: Gullah Geechee Nation,"On the Sea Islands along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia, a painful chapter of American history is playing out again. These islands are home to the Gullah or Geechee people, the descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to work at the plantations that once ran down the southern Atlantic coast. After the Civil War, many former slaves on the Sea Islands bought portions of the land where their descendants have lived and farmed for generations. That property, much of it undeveloped waterfront land, is now some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

But the Gullah are now discovering that land ownership on the Sea Islands isn‚Äôt quite what it seemed. Local landowners are struggling to hold on to their ancestral land as resort developers with deep pockets exploit obscure legal loopholes to force the property into court-mandated auctions. These tactics have successfully fueled a tourism boom that now attracts more than 2 million visitors a year. Gullah communities have all but disappeared, replaced by upscale resorts and opulent gated developments that new locals ‚Äî golfers, tourists, and mostly white retirees ‚Äî  fondly call ‚Äúplantations.‚Äù

Faced with an epic case of d√©j√† vu, the Gullah are scrambling for solutions as their livelihood and culture vanish, one waterfront mansion at a time.

France endured multiple constitutions, the heads of heads of state literally rolled, and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon. But how did all of this change the world, and how did it lead to other, more successful revolutions around the world? Watch this video and find out.

2605,6E9WU9TGr,"The Black Legend, Native Americans, and Spaniards: Crash Course US History #1","In which John Green kicks off Crash Course US History! Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we're mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn't get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.

In which John Green teaches you about capitalism and socialism in a way that is sure to please commenters from both sides of the debate. Learn how capitalism arose from the industrial revolution, and then gave rise to socialism. Learn about how we got from the British East India Company to iPhones and consumer culture in just a couple of hundred years. Stops along the way include the rise of industrial capitalism, mass production, disgruntled workers, Karl Marx, and the Socialist Beard. The socialist reactions to the ills of capitalism are covered as well, and John discusses some of the ideas of Karl Marx, and how they've been implemented or ignored in various socialist states. Plus, there are robots!

In which John Green teaches you about the early days of the Civil Rights movement. By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.

2,500 years ago, the writing of history as we know it didn‚Äôt exist. The past was recorded as a list of events, with little explanation for their causes beyond accepting things as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides to understand the reasons for them. Mark Robinson explains how ‚Äúhistory‚Äù came into being.

Lyrics


I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets but luckily i left the heater on.
And in my dreams i wrote the best song that i've ever written...can't remember how it goes.
I stayed drunk and fell awake and i was cycling on a plane and far away i heard you say you liked me.
We drifted to a party -- cool. The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

I found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.
Just then a song comes on: ""you can't always get what you want"" -- the rolling stones, oh woe is we, the irony!
The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm.
We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

You said ""we only live once"" so we touched a little tongue, and instantly i wanted to...
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.

In which John Green teaches you about the United States in the 1920s. They were known as the roaring 20s, but not because there were lions running around everywhere. In the 1920s, America's economy was booming, and all kinds of social changes were in progress. Hollywood, flappers, jazz, there was all kinds of stuff going on in the 20s. But as usual with Crash Course, things were about to take a turn for the worse. John will teach you about the Charleston, the many Republican presidents of the 1920s, laissez-faire capitalism, jazz, consumer credit, the resurgent Klan, and all kinds of other stuff.

I know from experience that the $50 Billion Dollar Man pulls no punches.

But even I was shocked by how the Q&A of our Dan Pena movie premiere went down. Dan get's questioned about Global warming and why people like him and Donald Trump simply seem to not care about this issue. Dan responds with his own answer to the question and claims that global warming is a fraud.

Until now only those who attended the exclusive event saw Dan offer to fight anyone in the room‚Ä¶

...brand climate change complete bullshit‚Ä¶

...and predict which countries Trump would soon bomb back to the stone age.

And now our most explosive conversation ever is available in full.

Watch the $50 Billion Dollar Man set London‚Äôs exclusive Curzon Mayfair ablaze as we discuss:

What it really takes for YOU to succeed
His hopes for ME!
Why the banks prove climate change is BULLSHIT
Why you should adopt a Dan Pena attitude to life
What you can learn from his most successful ever student Klaus Kleinfeld

‚ÄúFuckerberg‚Äù type leaders
Why London Real is better than Facebook

2646,T6c-umQ_hl,A History of Evil,"Animated Documentary-Mockumentary about Evil in western civilization from Ancient Greece to present day.

The film was intended to show what people have believed in and pointed to as evil throughout history.  It was meant to get you to think about what evil really is. It is meant to show that when we get too obsessed with ""evil"" we might end up taking part in it ourselves. 

One has to separate evil and human cruelty. Human cruelty is people not being nice to one another. Evil is soemthing else, it is something we have created, a word and a concept for things that are not acceptable. It is a label for things that we do not understand and dont want to understand. 

But is evil really ever a complete explanation for anything?

A lot of bad deeds has been done in the name of good. The people that did them ment good, are they evil?


OK, and finally,
This video is not meant to:

-blame wester culture and people for all the ""evil"" in the world. I'm european, and thought that I better stick to my own history.
-blame religion for all the evil in the world.
-claim that God is dead. (It is simply a reference to the philosopher Nietzsche, look him up.)
-offend anyone, race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
-claim that Elvis was evil.
-be an exact and complete account of the actual events that has taken place throughout history.
 
This was a student project, hence the ""unfinishedness"" and abrupt ending. I ran out of time. I might update it later.

Time to let it go
It won't let go of me
Hanging by a thread
Cutting the cord and then falling back into the
Black 'cause if I don't
If I wait 'til it feels right
I'll be waiting my whole life
Closing my eyes, remember how we were like
 
Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history

But that's history
O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o
That's the way it was
But that's history
 
I have a memory
You're visiting me at night
Climbing in my bed
You were so quiet that you never woke me
I love the way you could
See the good in everything
But, do we fuel the fire?
Closing my eyes, remember how we were like
 
Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history
 
Started with a word
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to
Read between the lines
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done

That's the way it was
But that's history
O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o
That's the way it was
But that's history
 
Well, I got a feeling
Darling, it's possible
'Cause love's got no ceiling
Now, that it's just so strong
And I got a feeling
Like everything is possible
I'm trying to change
M-m-m-m-m
 
Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me

2675,SrCxCoEdD8,Hidden History of the European Dark Ages - ROBERT SEPEHR,"The swastika (Âçê) was used as the cross of the Manicheans, a religious movement started in the latter half of the third century. that was founded by the Iranian prophet Mani in the Sasanian Empire. Manichaeism taught an elaborate dualistic cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness. Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious philosophy, Buddhism, Tantra, and Christian Gnosticism. 

Catharism  was a christian Gnostic movement that thrived in some areas of Southern Europe, particularly what is now northern Italy and southern France, between the 12th and 14th centuries. Followers were known as Cathars, and their beliefs were said to have been brought from Persia, influenced by concepts rooted in the Manichean philosophy. 

Robert Sepehr is an author, producer and independent anthropologist.

Lyrics:

You've gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feel you want to leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Are we?

No they don't teach you this in school
Now my hearts breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Are we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever




All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Are we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars, hotel rooms, and new tattoos, good champagne, and private planes
But we don't need anything
Cause' the truth is out, I realise that without you here like there's just a lie
This is not the end
This is not the end
We can make it you know it, you know

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

So don't let me go
So don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know
We can live forever

2697,PdsJs0UIm7,"HISTORY OF RELIGION (Part 1): PAGANS, NIMROD, & BABYLON","In order to understand the many lies that have given to us over time, we must be educated on the truth.  A main part of my ministry is to educate so that lies can be truly seen and bondage be broken.  Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion. In an effort to keep the time down, it's just a summary so if there is something left out or that you don't understand leave it in the comments and I will try to answer if I can.  I hope this blesses whoever watched.  The Lord says his people suffer for a lack of knowledge and my goal is to try and stop the suffering.

2709,Xk_vS32X54,"The very famous E.H. Carr quote and historiography at knowledgebeatsignorance.com,","What is history? Welcome to historiography at knowledgebeatsignorance.com 
Edward Carr said: 
Study the historian before you begin to study the facts. This is, after all, not very abstruse. It is what is already 
done by the intelligent undergraduate who, when recommended to read a work by that great scholar Jones of 
St Jude's, goes round to a friend at St Jude's to ask what sort of chap Jones is, and what bees he has in his bonnet. When you read a work of history, always listen out for the buzzing. If you can detect none, either you are tone deaf or your historian is a dull dog. The facts are really not at all like fish on the fishmonger's slab. They are like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean; and what the historian catches will depend, partly on chance, but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use ‚Äì these two factors being, of course, determined by the kind of fish he wants to catch. By and large, the historian will get the kind of facts he wants. History means interpretation.‚Äù",History

I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight
Like us? Did they ever fight
Like us?
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light
Like us, but they never tried
Like us
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (Two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between

Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I

2717,AVbQo3IOC_A,Fresh Prince of Bel Air - FULL THEME SONG,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVbQo3...

For a little bit better sound quality.

And if you got Bel Air'd...lol at you!

*I do not own the rights to this song*


The real Fresh Prince theme.

Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys
Who were up to no good
Startin making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and send me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear there're prissy, bourgeois and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",History

Edward Carr said: 
Study the historian before you begin to study the facts. This is, after all, not very abstruse. It is what is already 
done by the intelligent undergraduate who, when recommended to read a work by that great scholar Jones of 
St Jude's, goes round to a friend at St Jude's to ask what sort of chap Jones is, and what bees he has in his bonnet. When you read a work of history, always listen out for the buzzing. If you can detect none, either you are tone deaf or your historian is a dull dog. The facts are really not at all like fish on the fishmonger's slab. They are like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean; and what the historian catches will depend, partly on chance, but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use ‚Äì these two factors being, of course, determined by the kind of fish he wants to catch. By and large, the historian will get the kind of facts he wants. History means interpretation.‚Äù",History

 Singanalluru Puttaswamayya Muthuraju (24 April 1929 ‚Äì 12 April 2006),[3] known mononymously by his screen name Rajkumar(Kannada: ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤ú‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤Æ‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≥ç), was an Indian actor and singer in the Kannada Cinema. Widely acclaimed as one of the finest actor in the history of Indian Cinema, he is considered a cultural icon, and holds a Matin√©e idol status in the Kannada diaspora, among whom he is popularly adulated as Karnataka Rathna, Rajanna , Varanata ,Natasarvabhouma, Gaana Gandharva and Annavru . A method actor, Rajkumar entered the film industry after his long stint as a dramatist with Gubbi Veeranna's Gubbi Drama Company, which he joined at the age of eight, and got his first break as a lead in the 1954 film Bedara Kannappa, and went on to work in over 220 films, the 2000 super hit Shabdavedhi being the last one. Well known for his highly disciplined and simple lifestyle in both personal and professional fronts, Rajkumar was also an avid Yoga, Pranayama and Carnatic music performer. He is also credited for being the only Indian super star who stayed away from acting the vicious acts of drinking, smoking and uttering swear words in all the roles he performed in his long spanning career of close to 50 years. At the age of 71, he was kidnapped from his farm house at Gajanur by forest brigand Veerappan. He was released after 108 days. He died of cardiac arrest at his residence in Bangalore on 12 April 2006. In his film career, Rajkumar received eleven Karnataka State Film Awards, ten South Filmfare Awards, two National Film Awards and a National Film Award for Best Playback Singer. He received in 2002 the NTR National Award. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Mysore, and is a recipient of the Padma Bhushan and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1995 for the lifetime contribution to Indian Cinema. He acted with many heroines in southern Indian cinema, such as Kannada's Jayanti (in over 36 films), Pandaribai (18 films), Leelavathi (28 films), Bharati(28 films), Kalpana (19 films), Aarathi (13 films), B. Saroja Devi (10 films), Harini (8 films), Madhavi (6 films), Manjula (7 films), Jayamala(6 films), Lakshmi (5 films), Geetha (5 films), Saritha (5 films), Jayaprada (4 films) and others from neighbouring states.The Hindi actress 
Rekha made her debut as heroine in the film Operation Jackpotnalli CID 999 with Rajkumar. He acted under many directors of south Indian cinema, from B.R. Pantulu and Puttanna Kanagal to Shankar Nag and T. S. Nagabharana. Chi. Udaya Shankar has written dialogues and lyrics for 85 movies. He was known for only acting in Kannada movies, even though he got many offers from different movie industries in India.

I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",History

Hey girl I'm waiting on ya, I'm waiting on ya

Just pretending that we're cool and we know it too (know it too)
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

2756,k7ngnWJ6Hk,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. 

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones.

Through line and colour, he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world, showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena.

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

2768,jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",Art and Music

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art and Music

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary 

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here:  The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: 

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates  For more information about With One Voice, please visit their website:

About Invisible People: 

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can‚Äôt ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation‚Äôs most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath ‚Äì its founder ‚Äì and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America‚Äôs homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

2795,daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

Don't waste my time 
Darling I can hear
I‚Äôve always been weird I just needed you there
Just needed you there

I‚Äôve gone away and I‚Äôm not coming back
By this time next year so just forget that you care
And go back all those years

What makes you cry 
Did playtime pass you by
Always living in fear that you were never there
Well you were never there

I‚Äôve gone away and I‚Äôm not coming back
By this time next year so just forget that you care
And go back all those years
A time I can‚Äôt recall I‚Äôm told it happened in fall
We headed north up the coast your face turned white as a ghost
The restaurant stopped for a show but momma didn't back down

You‚Äôre gonna hate this song when I bury you in the ground
You'll hate this song when I bury you in the ground
You in the ground
You in the ground

2815,9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance: The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

Our talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like ‚Äúchord‚Äù and ‚Äúvoice leading‚Äù correspond to geometrical concepts like ‚Äúvectors in an orbifold.‚Äù This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.

Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life.

Free Press Houston and Work-Order are proud to announce the lineup for Day For Night, an experiential arts and music festival featuring digital artists and renowned musical acts on December 19 and 20 in Houston, TX. Our 2015 lineup represents the culmination of years of development.

Musical artists featured: Kendrick Lamar, New Order, Philip Glass Ensemble, Dillon Francis, Janelle Mon√°e, Flying Lotus, Death Grips, Madeon, Nicolas Jaar, Psychic TV, CocoRosie, Elliphant, Battles, Dan Deacon, Com Truise, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore, Holly Herndon, Julien Bayle, Indian Jewelry, U.S. Girls, Jont√© Moaning, Prince Rama, DERU, Matt Thibideau, Roman Gianarthur, Richard Ramirez, Christine Renee, Future Blondes, BOAN, Millennial Grave, Wrestlers, Children of Pop, B L A C K I E, Hearts of Animals, Josiah Gabriel, FLCON FCKER, The Vanity, Light Wheel,Jerk, Bart Black, Prismo, and DJ Fredster. 

This immersive experience showcases leading visual artists who will be employing varying mediums such as light, projection, LED, and sound. The visual lineup includes Casey Reas, Zach Lieberman, School for Poetic Computation, Refik Anadol, Markus Heckmann, Mark Eats, Kamil Nawratil, Nanotak, Gabriel Pulecio, Vincent Houze + AV&C, Masomenos, David Cihelna & Gene Han, Mathew Dryhurst, Alex Czetwertynski, Work-Order, Night Moves, and Neil Ebbflo. 


Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.

Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday, October 8, via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. 

Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, ‚ÄúThe festival's title, ‚ÄúDay For Night,‚Äù provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.‚Äù

With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",Art and Music

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

'Light' is composed by Jasun Martz and performed by THE ARTS (with members of The Orchestral Ensemble of New York) and is a part of Jasun Martz's symphony 'Disintegration' performed by The Intercontinental Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Choir.  If light could be captured and recorded it would sound like this. Beautiful, illuminating yet disquieting. 

For another version of Light (with Jasun on grand piano) click:


Jasun has said ""I consider my paintings 'photorealistic'- I paint people exactly as I see them.""

Lynette Melnyk is a contemporary abstract artist who interprets music in her art.

The two artists have combined their talents to create this art and music therapy video ‚ÄúThrough The Struggle‚Äù. This classical piece is composed by Tom Conti, and is one of 12 on his latest album, which is based upon the fact that we have physical and emotional reactions to certain musical progressions and patterns. Tom says of his music ""The fact that we compose them to help individuals reduce stress, anxiety, restlessness and emotional imbalances in a very natural way is no coincidence.‚Äù

2869,xhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music & Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org.",Art and Music

Angie Durbin is a New York based artist whose work is very calligraphic and rhythmic, inspired equally by the energy of people, letterforms and music. The compositions are never planned and are executed spontaneously using instincts and subconscious emotions. Her unique style is packed with symbolism and movements that give each viewer their own experience in each piece.

Staring straight down at the sink
I don‚Äôt even need to think
I‚Äôll pass the time with my dog Pitch 
Reminisce about a life we lived

Cuz I can fly a million miles away
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written on my face and it‚Äôs in the line

Sudden thoughts are such a shame 
Left alone they‚Äôll just turn to gray 
A chance that you might never take 
Sinks your soul and it stamps a date

Maybe you can reach me now and again 
But I don‚Äôt think that time is a friend 
AnymoreAnymore

It‚Äôs time I get a P.O. Box 
Collect the mail that I never got 
Buy a ship and sail far away 
to the life that got away

Cuz I can fly a million miles away 
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written in my face and it‚Äôs in the lie

2905,SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.

This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at  

I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.

I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.

I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about  in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.

Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends‚Äîand perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",Art and Music

But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

2943,HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.

In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.

Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‚ÄòArt and music are antidotes to intolerance‚Äô says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.

Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT‚Äôs January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.

On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.

She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, ‚ÄúAao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste‚Ä¶‚Äù

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

2963,XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.

This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.

Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.

Original music for 's 

SO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. 

I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",Art and Music

Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.

David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.

Now that the time has come...
Soon gone is the day

Deep as the wine dark sea
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me....

There like a bird I'd fly
High through the air
Reaching for the sun's full rays...
Only to find you there...

And in the night when our dreams are still...
Or when the wind flows free
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me...

   http://moyaokruga.ru/niva/Articles.as...

The competition was attended by pupils of the Children's Art School, who were prepared for it's performance by conductors teachers of this institution of additional education. The concert program included 26 everything numbers. It's includes a playing on musical instruments (solo performance) and dance numbers. For the first time, the jury presented the artworks of children studying at the art department of the School of Arts, also included musical and choreographic compositions, puppet shows.

The jury, which included: a methodologist of the department for coordinating the activities of educational organizations in the region of the Saratov regional educational and methodological center N.Ye. Mikhailova, lecturer of the cyclic commission ""Choral Conducting"" of the Saratov Regional College of Arts by name O.V. Oschepkova, a teacher of the highest category of the Central Children's Music School in Saratov, Ye.G. Alferova, teacher of the highest category of the Children's Art School.by name V.V. Kovaleva municipal formation ""City of Saratov"" T.V. Chubarov.
 I had to closely monitor the performance of the participants of the competition. To say that the guys and girls were not worried would be wrong. Of course, they long time and stubbornly went to it's concert to showing their skill and talent performed at this stage.

And to look, really was what here in. The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. 
Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too.
 Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.
The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.

The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.

Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young ‚Äústar‚Äù will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!

After a hiatus, London electronic Jazz outfit Portico Quartet has returned with a new album, and we have them in studio to play two tracks from the record, 'Endless' and 'A Luminous Beam.' Their compositions meld acoustic and electronic soundscapes, jungle-style breakbeats and loose percussive grooves. As the title of current album ""Art In The Age Of Automation"" suggests, they're not interested in musical regression, but rather in ""What it means to make music in the modern age, to mix human art and computer art.""

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

3002,0aO7m6O3g-g,"The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 - Naukuchiatal, Uttarakhand, India | CULTURE","BY AJAY JAIN

If you want to get a feel of art and culture, head to the Indian Himalayas for the annual Escape Festival that place in the summers. It takes place along the lakes of Naukuchiatal in the state of Uttarakhand, about an eight hour drive from New Delhi. Here is more about the festival as taken from the official website,  

""A unique festival started in May 2009 when a few musicians and like-minded people decided to get away from New Delhi for a few days. They chose a picturesque resort at Naukuchiatal, at the foothills of the Himalayas which became their Escape.

Escape, has grown since then to become one of India's foremost outdoor art, music & camping festival.

The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family. It is also one of the first festivals in the country set around a scenic getaway appealing to young and old alike. 

Three days. Two stages. One pristine lake. The lilt of music in the hills, the sublime experience of art, the unfettered sense of joy as you give into the magic of the moment.

Enough reasons to escape amidst the serene surroundings of Naukuchiatal. The three-day Escape Festival of Arts and Music, in its 6th Chapter in 2013, has slowly but surely become the cause of a mass exodus of all music fans from the summer heat. The Escape Festival of Art & Music addresses the needs of a wide group of artists and audience by bringing them together under one roof. It sets the benchmark in showcasing talent and creating a unique atmosphere of creative exchange and camaraderie amongst its attendees. The 'real time' experience coalesces into a unique experience which can only have the fitting title term of 'Escape'. 

An initiative by Potheads, the Escape Festival of Art & Music, is a creative retreat and will feature bands, artists, writers, photographers, painters, graffiti artists, performance artists, tattoo artists and potters, in a m√©lange of talent. In addition to that, the festival will also feature a festival camp, adventure sports and a flea market at the breathtaking venue right on the shores of Lake Naukuchiatal, Uttrakhand. The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family.

In its 6th Chapter, The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 will see the performances spread over three days and two stages - The Soul Garden Stage and the Magic Forest Stage.

The Soul Garden is aimed at a listening audience with the lake as a backdrop for the stage. This stage will feature some of the most musically talented artists from the genres of Jazz, Blues, Folk, Sufi and Rock Music from the four corners of India

The Magic Forest is an EDM (Electronic Dance Music) Stage supported by an elaborate array of lights and visuals. The Magic Forest Stage will feature National and International Artists from the EDM sub-genres of Chill, Dub-step, Drum'n'Bass and Psytrance Music.

The festival also features a mini film festival, which is the screening of independently produced documentaries by National and International film makers.

In the areas of Photography, Painting, Pottery, Graffiti and other art forms outdoor exhibitions, live painting, workshops and participation programs will be the order of the day wherein one will experience art in a natural setting.""

3015,#NAME?,Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,"When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.

Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.
New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.

Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.

Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.

New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.

 Special Head Levitation
He is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!

""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton
""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. 

The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.

The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

3018,N0u04EqNVj,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

Leon Botstein, Conductor / President of Bard College

President Leon Botstein of Bard College steps boldly into the fray to answer one of the most enduring human questions: What is art? This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

3021,dSMiYzBEPY8,Psychosocial programs like art therapy and music therapy help heal kids faster,"Childhood cancer is a family disease in that it affects the life of patients and their parents and siblings. Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. 

Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.

Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.

Where dips the rocky mountains,
To a soft and winter lake,
There lies a frosty island,
Where flapping herons wake.
With the sound of soothing rhyme,
Let me sing for you a time,
Of a world so far it seems,
Can be only found in dreams.

CHORUS:
Come away, O human child,
To the beauties of the wild,
Where your sorrows melt away,
For the worlds more full of weeping,
Than ye can understand.

As the waves of moonlight beckon,
For you to join me there.
As the soft, white jasmine petals,
Drift through the snowy air,
As the sounds of silence cease,
The melody of rest brings peace,
As the purring lions dance,
In the winter-tide brilliance,
As the sky above us glows.
And no more our troubles find us,
In this land that's free of woes.

CHORUS

Where the wandering waters fountain,
In the pools across the dale,
You can eye the reindeer prancing,
To their long forgotten tales.
As they leap and jump and bound,
Our hearts beat to the sound,
Under frosted, ivory sky,
With their sparkling antlers high,
Their hoof-beats serenade,
As we ride across the glade,
Through the silvery, silken snow,
In a wintry wonderland,
With the brisk wind at our backs.
Let me take you there...

CHORUS

As you close your eyes in slumber,
May you take me by the hand.
Let us go where joy and laughter,
Ne'r cease in that fair land.",Art and Music

The Academy of Gundishapur was founded by the Sassanid dynasty. The Gundishapur complex consisted of a university, a library, and a teaching hospital. 

Many scholars believe Shapur I son of King Ardeshir (Artaxexes) to have founded the Jondishapour after defeating The Roman army led by Valerian.  Shapur II made the city his capital.

It was by Khosrow Anushiravan decree that the famous physician Borzouyeh was sent off to India to gather the best minds and sources of knowledge of the day.

Borzouyeh is famous for having translated the ancient text of Panchatantra from Sanskrit into Persian, naming it ""Kelileh and Demneh"". Thus the Gundishapur University became an important center of science, philosophy, and medicine of the ancient world.",Art and Music

The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. 

Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. 

Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. 

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? 
The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. 

It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. 

Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching ‚Äî especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.

3038,UPk56BR1Cmk,Why art is important | Katerina Gregos | TEDxGhent,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Katerina Gregos is convinced that contemporary art has an important role to play in society, as one of the last frontiers of free expression. Today, artists and cultural practitioners, rather than politicians, are leading some of the key discussions about the state of the world. Contemporary artists challenge each and every one of us to reinterpret social and political events, and crack cemented opinions as well as dominant narratives propagated by the media and those in power. As an internationally respected curator, Katerina has curated a number of exhibitions dedicated to exploring the relationship between art, politics, democracy, the new global production circuits, and human rights. Let yourself be inspired by Katerina‚Äôs talk at TEDxGhent 2014, and find out what contemporary art can contribute to society.

HQ MP3 DOWNLOAD:: 

Dive deep within, use your intuition, and generate new and original ideas with this 'stream-of-consciousness' creative thinking tool - combining meditation music with binaural beats. 

As the surrealist film maker David Lynch once said: 

""Intuition is the key to everything, in painting, filmmaking, business - everything. I think you could have an intellectual ability, but if you can sharpen your intuition, which they say is emotion and intellect joining together, then a knowingness occurs."" 

The stream of consciousness is an unconventional tool which allows you to dive deep into your subconscious, and think or write in a free-form manner without worrying about external factors such as criticism or censorship. This stream contains an endless flow of feelings, memories, thoughts, and whatever else may exist in the far reaches of your mind. 

Many jewels can be found here - the stream of consciousness technique is a great way to generate new ideas. 

The first step is to 'loosen the girdles' of your conscious mind - just enough to allow free-form thought generation, but not so much that you find yourself becoming TOO zoned out. 

In this track, Alpha waves, associated with relaxed awareness and visualisation, are tempered / counterbalanced with Beta waves - a 2 minute interplay each-way which allows you to work fluidly at a rapid pace. An alpha segment may trigger a unique thought, and just as you find yourself floating away with the faries...bam! A beta wave kicks in, allowing you to maintain creative focus and jot down your insight in an clear and effective manner, before you dive deep again in order to either expand the idea further, or generate new ideas.  

Do this for the full 30 minutes, or as long as you like, and you may be surprised by what you find. Maybe most of it will be gibberish, but even if you discover one great idea the process will have been worth it. Use headphones at a low volume for best results. 

Alternatively you can listen in a rested state and contemplate ideas that way. One drawback to this method is that you may forget any valuable insights, but this is where a voice recording app may come in handy. 

You can also alternate between listening in a rested state, and during more active sessions where you are rapidly jotting down notes. A rested state for example can be used to contemplate the more valuable insights gained from the active session. 

Of course, writing is not the only way to generate ideas - if you're an artist, you use this track to come up with some surreal imagery.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.
Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.

He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

3058,lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /Ààp…ëÀêli…ô/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.

Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] Fran√ßois Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".

In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.

Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about.

Lyrics:
Music and art just cost so much
The school can‚Äôt pay for it and such
It‚Äôs just stressing the social divide
They take more time away from class
I feel like my students will never pass
How will we ever coincide?

But wait that‚Äôs not even the truth
There‚Äôs way more benefits for our youth
Than problems that you‚Äôll find
Academic s go through the roof
Listen on up there‚Äôs tons of proof
How could we have ever been so blind?

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
At least that‚Äôs what all the studies have found

Music and art for little kids
Can help develop reasoning and language
Earlier than you could ever bet
Music lessons help kindergartners perform best
On spatial-temporal reasoning tests
And there‚Äôs even more to come yet

It‚Äôs even better than a computer appliance
At teaching skills needed to do math and science
I‚Äôm telling you they‚Äôll help student to go far
Music Ed helps develop creative thought
This song hits that one on the dot
This presentation idea‚Äôs quite bizarre

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
The advantages you‚Äôll find will be profound

SPOKEN WORD FACTS

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
What they‚Äôre capable of might just astound

The arts can also have effects
In the behavior of its subjects
Discipline issues are rarely there
Students here do not misuse
They show the lowest substance abuse
Of high school students anywhere

And who does better on standardized tests
No matter what a child‚Äôs background may suggest
Students of the arts will succeed
And when your job hinges on that final grade
Thank the arts for all the aid
And helping your students achieve

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
Plus it‚Äôs much harder with music to feel down

And there‚Äôs even more ways to benefit
It teachers hard work and to commit
Only through practice can one excel
Rhythmic people tend to plan better
I guess not me putting this thing together
I don‚Äôt think that really went so well

But as I worked all through the night
This idea seemed to fit the topic just right
So I wrote it like this anyway
If there‚Äôs one thing I want you to learn
Embarrassing yourself like this should be no concern
When you teach you‚Äôll do it everyday

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
At least that‚Äôs what all the studies have found

And now I‚Äôm done standing up here like a clown",Art and Music

""Music has a way of carrying these Divine Vibrations, but music has to be Divine also.The music which is erotic or something very base or related to something very ugly doesn't work out. But if it is a proper music of a proper type then it communicates. But that discretion only comes after realization. What you enjoy there is the vibrations. You feel the cool vibrations and you start enjoying it...The cool vibrations soothe you down."" (Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi)

""The Awakening of the Kundalini in Sahaja Yoga takes place with the touch of Musical Notes. The notes touch the Chakras and the Kundalini gets awakened. The Kundalini reaches the Sahasrara through the Sushumna (Central Path) and through the Chakras. The the Kundalini becomes one with God.

3082,Pf1W5LfsEk,"BEST Background Instrumental Music - for Coffee, Creativity and Busy Work (Work Music)","STUDY MUSIC on ITUNES: http://bit.ly/smpitunes

This is the BACKGROUND INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC/ RELAXING MUSIC / COFFEE MUSIC PLAYLIST. Depending on what stage of life you are in right now, I have listed a summary of HOW and WHEN this music should be used. This playlist is particularly good if you find yourself in any of the following situations: 

Background Music Instrumentals for Office work: 
So, you've graduated from school/college and have now enter the real world. Not exactly as exciting as you would have imagined eh? Get through your 9-5 work day with this playlist. It will increase the productivity and make that busy work on your desk or your to-do list less painful.

Relaxing Music for Homework:
As you sit down at your desk, you realize you have been assigned 100 PROBLEMS for Math homework! That is just inhumane! How could they?! I mean granted, it's only every other odd number question, but STILL..you're not a robot! You need to enjoy life! They'll never understand. Don't worry, beat the boredom of mundane task by putting on this playlist. The beats will help you stay focused on this task, and chances are, you'll finish your homework before this playlist ends.

Concentration Music for Writing Essays and Reports: 
This is the last time you will leave 12-page papers or reports to the night before. That's what you said 3 papers ago, but here you are. But for sure, this is the last time. And that's that. Well, time is ticking, and you CANNOT afford to waste any of the 9 remaining hours you have left. Get some coffee, Put this playlist on with headphones, and DO NOT LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER. No more writer's block with this music. You will have this essay done after maybe..oh..8 more repeats of this playlist. 

Ultimately, this is the music of productivity. It is optimal for any task that requires kinetic learning, practicing, or motor execution. Improve yourself and make yourself more productive by listening to this playlist. 

1. Midnight Coffee 
2. Rainy Nights, Rainy Days 
3. Blue Deja Vu 
4. Neptune Illusion 
5. Jazzmine Tea 
6. Neo Gardens 
7. Tesseract 
8. Peace in Belize 
9. Smoothie Samba 
10. Sailing into Abyss 
11. Moon Among Trees 

This playlist is particularly good for:
-Fighting procrastination
-Finishing boring tasks
-Decrease anxiety
-Increase relaxation

Based on the research collected from the feedback of the Study Music Project, the following task should not be executed with this playlist: 
-If you are trying to memorize something. UNLESS you are falling asleep, and you need to pull an all nighter.
-If you are learning something very difficult for the very first time. UNLESS you are falling asleep and you need to pull an all-nighter.
-If you are taking a self-assessment/practice exam.
-If you are trying to meditate or practice yoga. 

This is NOT New Age music!

Music and art can be healing to the body and mind and she paints a beautiful picture for us showing how the two can come together in the form of the 'Creative Mind'.

An Autism champion for the South Surrey Autism board, Dr Mohan is passionate about bringing art and music together with the mind. In 2015, Dr Mohan founded iMANAS London, an organisation which aims to promote the integration of medicine, arts and neuroscience. A highly skilled artist and musician, Dr. Mohan travels the world as an invited guest speaker to discuss her work; her artworks have been displayed in exhibitions in both the UK and India. A formally trained Carnatic and Hindustani singer, Dr. Mohan believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness.

Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance and music. It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power, speed, and leverage for leg sweeps.
The word capoeira probably comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.

Lyrics:
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie

Lyrics:
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie

""Music has a way of carrying these Divine Vibrations, but music has to be Divine also.The music which is erotic or something very base or related to something very ugly doesn't work out. But if it is a proper music of a proper type then it communicates. But that discretion only comes after realization. What you enjoy there is the vibrations. You feel the cool vibrations and you start enjoying it...The cool vibrations soothe you down."" (Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi)

Music and Sahaja Yoga
""The Awakening of the Kundalini in Sahaja Yoga takes place with the touch of Musical Notes. The notes touch the Chakras and the Kundalini gets awakened. The Kundalini reaches the Sahasrara through the Sushumna (Central Path) and through the Chakras. The the Kundalini becomes one with God. Vibrations begin to flow, Yogis go into NIRANANDA (Joyful Meditation) and the seeker begins his journey on the path of evolution."" (Dr. Arun Apte)

""When a Sahaji listens to music, he hears it not through ears but through chakras. Chakras become the ears and Kundalini gets awakened"" (Dr. Arun Apte)

3234,kfBvz2rG-NI,Nina Burmi sings Thumri | Vocal & Tabla | Indian Classical Music,"#darbarfestival | Nina Burmi uses her smooth three-octave vocal range to explore the thumri style - a semi-classical genre intimately connected with dance, poetry, and drama.
‚ñ∫ Join our newsletter at  for the finest in Indian classical music and dance, and watch full length exclusive concerts in pristine HD on the Darbar Player: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Learn more about the music:

Thumri is a sensuous ‚Äòlight classical‚Äô style, originating in Uttar Pradesh. The word is derived from the Hindi ‚Äòthumakna‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòto walk with dancing steps so as to make the ankle-bells tinkle‚Äô, and the genre remains closely connected with dance and drama. Ragas are treated more flexibly, and songs are often devotional, romantic, or even erotic in nature. Lyrics have a central role, often being based on folk tales or classical poetry, and commonly depicting the separation of lovers, or myths of Lord Krishna.

Nina Burmi sings in the Kirana gharana style, tackling khayal, thumri, bhajan, and other forms. Currently living in the UK, she trained under the esteemed husband-wife pairing of Dilshad Khan and Parveen Sultana, and combines the latter‚Äôs wide vocal range with a more sparsely ornamented approach. In this song she is joined by top accompanists, with lyrics describing the tension and sorrow of a lover who is separated from Lord Krishna.

Recorded for Darbar Festival 2006

Music Karate ( Toshin, NPO International Music Karate Association )

Music Karate is a new style of karate, in which performers do karate with music. Since the introduction of the first performance in 1990, Toshin has been spreading this new field of karate from the City of Anjo. Currently, they perform at karate tournaments, school events, nursing homes and town events, as volunteers contributing to their society. The students create these music karate shows. Toshin is also involved with international exchange with their new brand of art. They have students ranging from the age 4, all the way to adult. You‚Äôll be quite impressed by their wonderful performance and your image for karate will too, be changed by what they do on stage. They are continuously making effort in order to spread the magnificent beauty of their art.

This audio, which can be used during work, study or meditation  uses alternating sequences of Beta, Alpha and Theta waves to encourage fluid and abstract creative thinking (Alpha & Theta), while at the same time maintaining a state of focus (Beta) for effective problem solving and high-level information processing.

 ‚ñ∂Specs

For each one hour session, the frequencies cycle through three frequency bands in 5 minute increments....

Beta (12Hz) ‚Üí Alpha (8-8.5hz) ‚Üí Beta (13Hz) ‚Üí Theta (7-7.5hz) ‚Üí Beta (14hz) ‚Üí Alpha (10hz) ‚Üí Beta (14.5hz) ‚Üí Theta (7-7.5hz) ‚Üí Beta (15hz) ‚Üí Alpha (10hz) ‚Üí Beta (15.5hz) ‚Üí Theta (7-7.5hz)

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation.

‚ñ∂How do I listen?

Headphones are recommended for best results. Listen at a quiet volume, or any level that you find non-intrusive. Listen during study or any task which requires focus and 'out-of-the-box' thinking. The addition of alpha and theta waves means that you can also use this session for creative visualisation, for which is a rested state is ideal.

Crickets sound is the most typical and soothing sound of the forest sounds in summer. In this video you will listen in High-Fidelity audio the crickets chirping at night in summer to help you to sleep.

BTW, I give you useful information about crickets to break a mith: they chirp with their wings, not their legs! :-o

The sound emitted by crickets is commonly referred to as chirping; the scientific name is stridulation. Usually only the male crickets chirp, however some females crickets do as well. The sound is emitted by the stridulatory organ, a large vein running along the bottom of each wing, covered with ""teeth"" (serration) much like a comb. The chirping sound is created by running the top of one wing along the teeth at the bottom of the other wing. As the male cricket does this, he also holds the wings up and open, so that the wing membranes can act as acoustical sails. It is a popular myth that the cricket chirps by rubbing its legs together. ( Wikipedia )

I hope you'll enjoy it. Use headphones for a better experience. Sleep Well :)

(Information and introduction of the composers)


Nicholas Fitzgerald:

""I'm Nick Fitzgerald, currently living in Los Angeles, and have been making music for 14 years. I have a B.S. in Music Technology, and got my start in the professional world as a sound designer for video games in 2007. Since, I've moved on to sound editing, music editing, and composing for multimedia. I've always had a passion for Sci-Fi and the creativity involved opens doors for composers to be as as imaginative as the material. Hopefully we can come up with something fulfilling to us all that achieves the vision that Star Citizen has.
Some of my work can be found here:  ""


Fernando Pepe:

""My name is Fernando Pepe from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'm 22 and I started to composing last year but I play guitar/piano since 12 years old.
I work with game development (indie game) on soundtracks, sound design, etc.. I took responsibility for it and I'm improving my knowledge since I really like the matter.
Find more about my work here: 


Caden L Welborn:

I'm a twenty one year old musician, composer, and orchestrator. I've been playing the piano since I was two and creating music since I was four. Over the years I've made music of all different genres of music, from piano, electronic, orchestral, to everything in between. I've also released four albums of various genres over the years with my most recent one being the electronic album Retr0grade.
I created this group to do something that has never been done before. The creation of a professional quality unofficial/fan made soundtrack for a game that is still being worked on. I believe we soundly accomplished this goal.

You can find my works here: 
And here: 


Yuchen Tian:

""My name is Yuchen Tian. I currently live in Richmond, Virginia. I have been playing guitar since 14, with genres ranging from indie rock to metal. I make electronic dance music such as trance and eurodance. I also from time to time write other kinds of music as you can hear on my SoundCloud page. I don't have any formal musical education, but I have a great feeling for music, and that helps greatly on writing music.
I've always been a lover of space and space sims. Star Citizen is a long awaited dream. It is my pleasure to work on such projects with other talented people.
Most of my songs are located at  I welcome any comments and criticism.""

Dance, boogie wonderland.
Ha, ha, dance
Boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says,'Baby, uh, uh, it don't work'
You say your prayers though you don't care; you dance and shake the hurt
Dance, boogie wonderland
Ha, ha, dance
Boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night; I chase my vinyl dreams to Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
'Boogie wonderland, wonderland'

3273,7pKQ6bSCM,"Heartbeats: When you call on God, music transforms from ‚Äòart‚Äô to ‚Äòheart‚Äô","Born to a mother who was a performing Carnatic vocalist and eminent teacher, music is a way of life in my family. I was introduced to Carnatic vocal and violin at a young age and music practice quickly became a daily ritual. As the intensity of my training increased, I felt a greater connection to the art form from gaining skill, but it wasn't until I experienced a spiritual bond that I recognized the value of music in my life. Entering Swami's fold happened later during tumultuous times at home, and undoubtedly, the musical and bhajan aspect is what drew me so close to Him. I am the most whole and centered version of myself when singing or playing a bhajan; these moments of connection are unparalleled. Carnatic music has since become a profession, and there are moments when I don't feel as connected or passionate from focusing on the technicalities or anxieties of performance. During these moments, my reset is to step back and play or sing a bhajan. The instant rush of affection toward Swami restores confidence, perspective, and purpose within me.

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya de ya

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself.
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes,
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home.

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know.

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

Lyrics:

A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al

When @bastilledan sent me happier for the first time I was taken back. The amount of emotion that you could feel in the lyrics was crazy. As I listened to the song more and more it reminded me of so many things I‚Äôve been through in my life. Toxic relationships, letting go of things I didn‚Äôt want to and just situations where happiness came with a sacrifice. Recently I lost my best friend, my companion, my life long friend. I wanted this video to embrace the pain that we feel losing or sacrificing something and the cycle of life that comes with it. I hope this song and video can bring closure in any situation you may be and make us all happier üíõ

This audio, which can be used during work, study or meditation  uses alternating sequences of Beta, Alpha and Theta waves to encourage fluid and abstract creative thinking (Alpha & Theta), while at the same time maintaining a state of focus (Beta) for effective problem solving and high-level information processing.

 ‚ñ∂ Specs

For each one hour session, the frequencies cycle through three frequency bands in 5 minute increments....

Beta (12Hz) ‚Üí Alpha (8-8.5hz) ‚Üí Beta (13Hz) ‚Üí Theta (7-7.5hz) ‚Üí Beta (14hz) ‚Üí Alpha (10hz) ‚Üí Beta (14.5hz) ‚Üí Theta (7-7.5hz) ‚Üí Beta (15hz) ‚Üí Alpha (10hz) ‚Üí Beta (15.5hz) ‚Üí Theta (7-7.5hz)

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation.

‚ñ∂How do I listen?

Headphones are recommended for best results. Listen at a quiet volume, or any level that you find non-intrusive. Listen during study or any task which requires focus and 'out-of-the-box' thinking. The addition of alpha and theta waves means that you can also use this session for creative visualisation, for which is a rested state is ideal.

Mastering any physical skill takes practice. Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease, speed, and confidence. But what does practice actually do to make us better at things? Annie Bosler and Don Greene explain how practice affects the inner workings of our brains.

Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face

Layin' down on someones bed
A girl that I had hardly met
My head is spinnin' like I've been out days

Now you're waking up too
Lying next to me in your room
Not quite used to someone so new
Did ya catch my name, yeah

Wonder how long I slept in
I don't know where the hell I've been
But I know that's all right

Last night we met at one
Drank till two
Danced till four
Walked you home
Awake till dawn
Slept till noon and
Now I want more

I got that taste oh
It's in my mouth it's like I had too much last night
It just felt so right
Because of you, now
I could go or I could stay 'cause I
Got nothing planned today
And I know that's all right

Last night we met at one
Drank till two
Danced till four
Walked you home
Awake till dawn
Slept till noon and
Now I want more

Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy yeahso, so easy oh...

Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home

Yeah, last night was fun lets do it again
We both know we're more than friends
And I know that's all right

Lyrics:

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight
Let this groove get you to move
It's alright (alright) alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright) alright
Gonna tell what you can do with my love
Alright
Let you know girl
You're looking good you're out of sight
Alright
Just move yourself
And glide like a seven-forty-seven
And lose you're self in the sky
Among the clouds in the heavens 'cause

Group musik asal kota bogor ini dibentuk tahun 2012.
Sebelumnya band ini bernama JASMINE. Tapi kemudian awal tahun 2019 diganti menjadi KARTINI.
Terdiri dari 4 perempuan cantik dan independen, Ressyana Dwi Oktora (Achie) pada Vocal, Siva Fauzia (Cimot) pada Bass, Gita Kirana pada Keyboard, dan Relindia Seftiani (Abel) pada Gitar.

Berbekal pengalaman bermusik yang cukup lama, akhirnya KARTINI memutuskan untuk masuk ke industri musik indonesia secara lebih profesional. Pada awal tahun 2019, Kartini di pertemukan oleh Om jana, seorang produser yang pada akhirnya menaungi KARTINI didalam Positif Art Entertainment

Lagu berjudul ""Luka"" yang dikarang oleh Abel KARTINI ini di pilih sebagai single pertama KARTINI.
Dengan harapan, diterima dan disukai telinga dan hati seluruh pendengarnya.

Lirik Lagu LUKA :

Semua yang telah kau beri 
berubah menjadi luka
Kau hancurkan perasaan yang telah lama ku tinggikan 
dan sengaja kau biarkan

Segala yang telah ku jaga
Tak bisa menjadi indah
kau memilih untuk tetap meninggalkan cerita kita
dan melupakan semua

kau meninggikan ku, lalu menjatuhkan aku
seakan aku tak punya perasaan
kau putuskan untuk pergi membiarkan hidupku
tetap bersama bayangan dirimu

Aku sudah mati rasaa
Telah habis tak tersisa
Kau bawa pergi",Art and Music
